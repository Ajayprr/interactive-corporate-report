84917689333_10156152969624334,Simply put don't go to Applebees they have bad service and managers are way worse. They are known to have bad service on the island. Our server was friendly but just extremely forgetful of just basic things. Food was cold. Management was very rude and didn't really try to properly fix the issues. Go to Dave and busters we had amazing service there. Both server and management wise.  And no I don't want any gift cards or anything from Applebees. The bad service left that bad of a taste.

The lack of professionalism of the officer or mall cop needs to be called into question also, for he also had the accountability to question the accuser to gauge the validity of the accusation before making an approach. Your staffer's description is seriously far too vague--one was seeking an African American to blame.

Applebee's--you need to execute your actions publicly with acknowledgement of the questionable and ill-warranted actions of YOUR brand staff. To be dismissive without any accountability does a disservice to your staff, your patrons, and your brands...all while further victimizing the heart of these young women.

My friend and I were shopping at the independence center in independence, Missouri(Near Kansas City), when we were done we decided to get a bite to eat at Applebees. About an hour into out dinner we were approached by a Independence police officer, a mall cop, and the restaurant manager. We were told that we were accused of eating and not paying for CHICKEN the day before (dining and dashing). Mind you that we have proof that can show our whereabouts and its not even in our character to steal. After being mocked, humiliated, and embarrassed we were asked to pay for our food, leave, and not come back. After leaving, calls were made to the restaurant and the manager stated that our accuser remembered that there was a SKINNY girl and a girl who wore MAKEUP. In 2018 is this really what were debased to? Our weight and whether or not we wore makeup. She could not recognize any facial features or any defining characteristics . This is a clear example of RACIAL PROFILING that should not be stood for. Just because we are black does not mean we are all criminals and I will not be treated as

Mind you we're still with our original fill on our beverages.  Never asked if we needed refills.  My food looked like it was haphazardly thrown together and my daughter's triple bacon burger was missing the BBQ sauce.  We would have complained to the waiter, if he ever bothered to show himself again.   We unhappily ate.  My husband finished his sofa and proceeded to drink my tea with me since no one was around for refills.  We paid at the kiosk (no tip) since he never brought us a check or asked if we wanted dessert.

84917689333_10156123330424334,"I am not one to complain on social media, but my attempt at dinner tonight at your South Boston, VA left me incredibly upset. My complaint is long winded, but I felt you should have all the details. I am a mother of 17 month old twins, and, needless to say, we dont go out to eat often-maybe once or twice a month- so tonight was a treat. 

We arrived a few minutes after 7pm as part of a party of 8 + two in high chairs and were seated promptly in a large corner booth, as the restaurant wasnt full. 
We had to ask for high chairs again 20 minutes later, and when they arrived two servers told me they couldnt have high chairs in the aisle and moved us to the booth directly beside our group. Ok, no big deal...so we moved the 4 of us over. I ordered a tea and French fries to keep the twins busy because dinner was impromptu and I had come straight from the babysitter and had no snacks in their bag. Thankfully, those made it to us. 

Approximately 40 minutes after we ordered, and 10-15 minutes after my husband had to walk over and ask the hostess to help us get our check because of the lack of service, his salad arrived. We had already packed up the diaper bag, and I had gotten one of the twins out of the high chair and sat him in my lap while we waited to pay for the untouched salad, tea, and fries. The beer my husband ordered when we sat down, along with our appetizer, had never made it to us. Let me interject at this point that our twins were still I good spirits and had not been fussy, which is always a plus when youre going out as a family. 

Right after the salad came my entree, and I was going to ask for a box, but when our server brought it and rudely dumped it on our table, she disrespected my family by saying loudly enough for several tables to hear, in regards to the twin still sitting and the two high chairs, These things are in the way! and pushed the empty one angrily (but wait, shes one of the two servers who moved us from one booth to the other...)

At this point I became very upset because her actions not only were uncalled for, but several tables started looking over at us. I stood up with the baby in my lap, grabbed the diaper bag, and walked to the waiting area by the front door to wait on my husband to pay.  It was at this point that twin started crying, so I walked out to put him in the car. 

My husbands entree came as I was standing up to leave, and he told the server we were leaving and that he wanted to pay for the tea and French fries we ate, like he told the hostess 10-15 minutes before we got any of the entrees. A server called a manager over, and he told my husband we had to pay for it all because it was already prepped. So, my husband asked to have the two entrees boxed, to which he was told they couldnt because his entree had already been taken back to the kitchen. As the final blow, he was told we had to pay for it all, even though we had been trying to get the check well before the entrees arrived at our table. 

So, nearly an hour after we had been seated, we went home $25 lighter, with no meal to show for it.",,status,,2018-02-10 04:00:18,1,2,0

Saturday night I ordered takeout from your Suffolk, Virginia location and among my items was a Blondie. My wife noticed the brownie was very dry. When I attempted to heat it in the oven on low it did no good. It was at this point, at around 10 pm, that I decided to use the customer feedback link on your webpage. 

Apparently all this feedback page does is sign you up for junk email, because since Saturday I have received two emails for appetizer discounts with the purchase of an entree, but no actual person contacting me.

Were actually here now and we walked in and had two servers walk by us. I understand they are servers but customer service is customer service. I e sat here and watched another staff do it four times to three groups of people. Took 10 mins for our server to show up. There are legitimately six tables in here and people are just walking around doing nothing. Let me say I was server for years and I know what it takes. We only come here on occasion because my son likes it. Weve walked out several times because we stood unattended at the door for at least 15 mins. They really need to step their game up.

I explained she was visiting and had her SA I.D and he refused to look at it. Then after arguing with us for a few minutes i told him she had her passport but he still refused to see anything that wasnt American. He said it was all pretty much fake and if it wasnt American he wasnt trying to see it. He also said and i quote  i dont know the laws in South Africa so i cant serve you any drinks. I replied, it wouldnt matter what the drinking laws in any other country were as long as she met the requirements of the American laws. Shes 21 BTW. AND the laws in SA say you can drink once youre 18. So it STILL wouldnt matter. So long story short, the service that night was HORRIBLE.

There is absolutely no excuse for tables not to be properly cleaned between patrons..
The workers that ""clean"" the tables throw the cleaning rags down where they want..they never sanitize them..they use the SAME cloth to wipe the seats where people sit and then wipe the tables with them..That is not only disgusting but totally against health department standards....

Yesterday..AFTER our table had been ""cleaned""..I took an anti bacterial wipe and went over the table..

Is THIS acceptable to APPLEBEE'S??? I don't think so..

Every single table must have the same filth on them..packed with bacteria..

I suggest APPLEBEES in Cheyenne gets their act together..
Our server was terrific but the tables are filthy dirty..
I hope they see this and correct this situation NOW..

84917689333_303477570089194,"Went for our annual Mother's Day get together on Saturday to the location in Lexington, NC.... not a good experience. For the price of this entree, this amount of chicken was very disappointing. There were 4 of us and we ordered 2 of the 2 for $20 with appetizers. 2 of us got our appetitzer (salad) quickly. We had time to eat it and wait 10 more minutes and the other appetizer (chicken) still hadn't come so we asked about it (they were NOT busy- the restaurant was less than half full). It came about 3 minutes later and was warm, at best. The entrees were another 15 minutes coming. Our server seemed to not know what to do so we didn't say anything else to her so as not to fluster her further and we did not bother to say anything to the manager because she was too busy propped up on the bar singing. She never walked around or spoke to anyone other than the employees the entire time we were there. That is surely not a requirement, but maybe if she walked around at least once every 30 minutes she would notice people waiting a long time for food. Apparently this location has ongoing isses because I see their rating on TripAdvisor is only a 3.5 and now we know why.",,photo,https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=303477570089194&set=o.84917689333&type=3,2017-05-15 10:41:45,0,1,0

First my salad came out and had a huge piece of ice in it, they make me another which took 25 minutes, by then my husband was almost done eating. They finally bring out another salad and my chicken had been refried and tasted like pure grease, it took her 10 minutes to bring my fork, and another 10 minutes to bring my salad dressing. Then we noticed after my husband was halfway through his food that he didn't get his shrimp nor the parmesan. But by then he had already eaten most of it and we had been waiting so long for my food that we didn't bother having it replaced. Worst experience ever. The sad part is, they didn't even offer to take something off the bill or apologize.

First off, it took at least 5 minutes for someone to come and take a drink order. My perfect margarita was served with no napkins, straw or pick for the olives, and only half of the glass rim was coated with salt, and it was served with a very thin slice of lime. How are you supposed to squeeze a slice of lime?
When I unwrapped the silverware, my fork was dirty, something green and dried on the fork.
This made the whole dinner off kilter, so we ordered my ribs to go. As soon as they arrived, we left. When we got home, I opened the container of ribs, only to discover, they were burnt to a crisp, and completely ruined.

She said they'll start cooking it right then, but by that time we were done waiting and went and grabbed fast food. The time before that there was a long piece of hair in my food. As soon as the waitress set it down I saw it and so did she. She was as grossed out as I was. She apologized and said they would remake my order. By the time my plate was brought out everyone else was done eating though. Tonight I ordered the 7oz Parmesan and shrimp sirloin with grilled vegetables and mashed potatoes. As soon as I cut into it it was tough. After hacking away at it I saw it was ALL GRISTLE! I tried to find spots on this small steak that weren't tough but couldn't.

My order was for car side and was to be ready by 4:27pm. I sat and waited until 4:40pm and decided to see what was going on with my order. The response we don't have anyone working Carside today. It would be nice to have a sign posted saying that. I go inside for my order and it wasn't ready. I was told we didn't make it because we are out of steak, and what would I like them to do. I said nothing I'd just like a refund. The guy says let me talk to my manager. In a very rude voice I got ""you can't have cash back, so what would you like to do (very rude voice). You know you can only get it back on your card."" I didn't ask for cash, so why would it be assumed that I was expecting cash. I'm fully aware that it has to come back on my card. He then said ""well it's going to take 3 days can you wait (very rude voice)"" I'm well aware I just want my refund. He then said "" well you won't have proof of the refund"" I said well you can write something out. There was no apologies or anything. They wasted my time and energy.

We were waiting and the tablet on the table did not work.

Waited almost 15 minutes before our drink order was taken then about 10 minutes later the server had to come back and ask us again for our drink orders.

When the waitress finally came to take our food order and drink order cause it all happened together or I guess it wouldn't happen at all she sat at our table and yawned 

When we asked the waitress about food she just stared blankly at us with no information just recommended other food. 
Me: ""Is this big burger Monday any good?""
Server: ""mhmm I think for a dollar more you can make it a quesadilla burger""

When we got our apps we didn't get plates to share our apps so everyone was eating off of two plates

The foods presentation was awful and the fries were over cooked and looked like a pile of...

The burgers were actually good

I pulled our food out and there was no dressing included with my southwestern steak salad and there are only 4 tiny pieces of steak. Looks nothing like the pic online. How do I eat a salad with no dressing?? The steak was also cold The other entree ordered was the shrimp wonton stir fry. The portion is so tiny and definitely not worth the price. I attached a pic. It didn't even fill up the bottom of the container! And this was taken BEFORE anything was eaten. I know this would be much larger if we ordered in restaurant. Same for the chips and salsa. Overpriced and portioned ridiculously small. And they gave us 3 spoons to eat our meals with. We didn't order soup! Extreme fail with this order.

84917689333_10155090592101834,"Normally I am a huge Applebee's fan. After tonight however, I am very disapointed. The night started out by my party of four ordering a round of Long Island Ice Teas. We waited so long for our drinks to get brought to us that we felt compelled to instantly order another round so that our second set of drinks would get served to us during our meal time and not afterwards. 

When it came time to order, I ordered the half rack of ribs, and the other people in my party ordered other items. We waited an abnormally long time for our food to get served, but we weren't bothered by this until our food got brought to the table. When my ""half rack of ribs"" were placed in front of me, I was at a loss for words. I couldn't believe how small they were. I have never been served such a pathetic rack of ribs in my life. I guess the menu forgot to mention that the ""half rack of ribs"" actually come from a hampster...  Very disappointing, especially from a restaurant I love and frequent often.",,photo,https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10155090592101834&set=o.84917689333&type=3,2017-02-25 20:41:40,7,4,0

The lady and i showed up and waited 15 min to be seated at a table that was open before we arrived later we ordered 2 long Island I've teas, 1 large blue moon, 1 spinach dip app, 1 3 cheese cav, and 1 classic combo. The appetizer showed up right after the drinks and was up to temp and an ok amount but my blue moon was not. It tasted more like a cheap homemade hoppy craft beer but i drank it without even saying a word because I'm the type of person to not complain but as you can see, tonight is going to be an exception. Later our main meals come to the table and the first thing we noticed is that the 3 cheese cav had 3 thin strips of chicken and a tablespoon of tomato slices. The lady said this isn't going to work and the waitress took it back to ""fix it"". In the meantime i said let's eat some dip while we wait for your food. The first bite i took was slightly over chilled and the cheese was not melted. So to keep my cool, i just didn't eat the rest and thought to take it home for later. The lady's food finally got back and we noticed all they did was add a 4th strip of chicken and more cheese and we gleamed at it thinking all of that for just under 13 dollars is just not anywhere near worth it so after that we just sat and ate what we had. Like i said, we aren't ones to complain about service but tonight is different. Also i decided to leave a survey about our service but half way through i got this screen after clicking next to leave comments about the service.

I guess you can order drinks, appetizers, deserts and pay your bill on this Ted.  We don't like nor want to use Ted.  Not sure what you need wait staff for if you expect all to use this gadget.  My issue is when we wanted to pay the waitress never came to the table with the bill.  We even alerted Ted that we needed the waitress to come to the table.  She never came.  We than went to the register and was informed that we could go back to our table and pay using Ted.  We told the young man no.  When the waitress finely came so that we would pay she was rather disinterested and rather put out.  She stood with her foot out hand on hip looking up in  the air rolling her eyes.

Let me start by saying our server was absolutely awesome, this had nothing to do with her. I ordered my steak ""as rare as possible"" and it came out light pink, more like medium well. My boyfriends enchilada came out looking like a sloppy disgusting mess. We're not the type to complain, so we let it slide and chalked it up to an off night. I thought it couldn't get worse until I ate a few string beans and pulled this short blonde hair out of my mouth & almost threw up. We did not complain to the staff because my boyfriend felt embarrassed, and therefore I had to make sure this was addressed somewhere. Here is a photo of both my receipt and the hair in question. Really Applebees?

I'm extremely disappointed in your ""Top Shelf Long Island Iced Tea"" now as a previous bartender I know what this drink consists of: Gin, Tequila, Vodka, Rum, Triple Sec, Sour Mix and a splash of coke. Honestly you'd be lucky to fit one shot with sour and coke in this glass considering how much ice it has. Not only that, the fact that it's so watered down makes it worse. The drink was consumed in literally 3 maybe 4 sips. Now we love Applebee's but sadly EVERYTIME we come it's the same disappointment with this drink. Maybe you should cut the Ridiculous amount of ice or try a different glass bc if I'm paying top shelf money I expect to have my top shelf drink. Or at the very least a Long Island that consists of all the Ingredients with the correct amount of ice so it does not water down. Thank you.",,photo,https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10208483691394939&set=o.84917689333&type=3,2017-01-23 19:46:03,12,8,1

Last night I ordered the fire grilled vegetables a premium that they charge you extra for. the my dinner came the was only 2 very small pieces of vegetables on the plate - extremely skimpy. I ask the server about it and she said she would take care of it. She brought me a place with the proper serving size of vegetable;es on it.

84917689333_137631713399072,"Hello,

We are a small New York-based startup with a mission to save the planet by reducing food waste, feed the hungry and help food businesses make an extra revenue. You can join today - its completely free and you will get the chance to sell the surplus food that ends in the bin at the end of your service. Interested in joining our cause?

This is how it works: 

You list the surplus food (which was going to waste at the end of service) on our app and state the time when customers can come and pick it up.

The amount of meals is unlimited and completely under your control, as well as the time of collecting. You will be paid half of the original price of the meal,This leaves you with a hassle-free closedown, more money in your pocket and the exposure to new potential customers.

Lets reduce food waste, protect the planet and feed some bellies together!

We would love to hear from you and get you started on this great cause, you can reach us at contactus@noonesleepshungry.com

Stopped in there to have lunch because I received gift cards for Christmas from my father. We ordered the spinach artichoke dip and it came out burnt, black and brown all the way around the dish and then also on the top. Asked for a new one because it tasted awful. Got my second one and it was great. My daughters boyfriend got the chicken tenders basket and the chicken was almost none was pretty much just the breading yuck. My daughter and my friend both got the mac n cheese and they both hated it. They wasn't alone the lady setting behind us ordered the same thing and also didn't eat it because it was nasty. I got the southwestern chicken salad glad I did pretty hard to mess that up so all in all I was the only one that ended up getting to eat. The manager did offer to replace their food but we didn't have time to wait for  more food.  So we go to leave I had to go to the restroom and look up to find that. Yes that is black mold!! That can and will make people very sick, as on my way out I started to have an asthma attack and had to stop to use my inhaler.

BABYGIRL! When will you bring your services to the Los Angeles area! How much longer must I wait to have your delicious mozzarella sticks within a reasonable distance from me. I have waited, I have stood proud, stood firm in waiting. Many have tried to replace you; B dubs, T.G.I.Fridays,, the cheesecake factory, the numerous organic hip Los Angeles restaurants who serve organic vegan, grass fed mozz cheese covered in low calorie high multi-vitamin grain breaded sticks. But no, you have been too good to me to hurt, the only woman in my life whose never hurt me (i may have cheated on you with Pizza Hut's stuff crust pizza but you knew I was gonna be right back, like HOV says). How, after all we been through, you make me have to travel an estimated 20+ miles (In LOS ANGELES) for these sticks! You know how much of a surge an uber be at peak half price app hours! YOU PREACH ""MHH EATING GOOD IN THE NIEGHBOORHOOD"" not ""MHHH EATING GOOD IN THE COUNTY NEXT TO YOU FAM COME ON OVER"" 

With Kind Regards,

The boneless wings came out so over cooked you couldn't cut them with a knife. The celery was literally rotten (I have pics for proof). The spinach dip was so over microwaved that it tasted like fish. They replaced our wings in about three minutes  (how do you cook wings that quickly?) And the celery on this plate was even more rotten. 
When the manager Katie came over and we explained our issue her first response was ""I didn't know they were sending out rotten food"". Really? As a manager you don't know what is leaving your kitchen... but your kitchen staff absolutely knew they were sending out bad food. 
All in all she took the appetizer off the bill. The only good thing about this place was the bartender Dara.

Hi I'm the daughter in law of Becki (Rebecca) Horton. I started a gofundme page for her husband Danny Horton; I will also post updates when they are available. Danny has been diagnosed with small cell lung cancer; the tumor is so large his right lung is collapsed. He has started chemotherapy treatments and soon will start radiation as well. These treatments are taking a toll on him. He has been unable to work for the past month, and we're not sure when he will be able to return to work. He was the main provider for the both of them. If you're able to make a contribution of what ever size please do so. I provided the link above. Please share the gofundme link on your Facebook page and by mouth. The name of the gofundme is ""Help for Danny Horton"". Prayers are greatly appreciated.
Thanks in advance,

The waitresses took forever to acknowledge us to start and then tried to rush us to order. I ordered the new Southwestern Steak Salad. I was told that Chimichurri was spicy so I asked that they not put that on my steak and put my dressing on the side. When my salad came out it had nothing but cheese on the top of the lettuce. I told the server that this was wrong and was told that the kitchen staff said that's how the salad should be made. (Why does the staff not know how to make the food and the server need to take them the menu to show them a picture)? She took it back and it came back WITH Chimichurri on the steak. I asked to speak to a manager and he promised to fix my problem....see below.  It was not fix in fact the salad was worse and I never got a chance to eat. Wiping off the Chimichurri, putting dressing on my salad, and giving me raw steak was unacceptable. The manager didn't even come back out. At this point I was totally disgusted and had zero interest in eating anything.",,photo,https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10207447777658522&set=o.84917689333&type=3,2016-08-08 09:13:10,0,1,0

But the kicker was my mom got the new southwest steak salad. It came cold she told the waitress and it was remade second one came out cold again but she decided to deal with it because we had to go. She cut into it and it was rare, she asked for a medium steak. After lunch the manager came over to chat with us and he actually tired to argue what the steak was cooked to and that this was medium. If this is his idea of medium he needs to go back and retake his food handler exam. My husband is a chef I sent him a picture he told me that was really rare. You need to teach your managers better food handling or someone is going to get sick. And  since both of our lunches where over salted and uncooked we ended up eating an hour later after my appointment. Very disappointing..

We were warned about food shortages and long waits due to fact they were running on generators (Over 70,000 power outages from a severe and 70-100 mph storm). We didn't mind since we had seen the damage around town...power lines down and multiple-decades old trees uprooted. Our waitress informed us that they were almost out of food already just from the day ""and didn't know what they were going to do for the weekend!"" As we were waiting for our food we noticed an older couple who were also waiting for their food. I could feel the impatience from their table. He kept glancing at the floor, she kept pointing her finger, and taking pictures of ""the mess."" Then when they received their food they asked ""we've been waiting an hour....if it was even warm still?....now we're going to have to eat at McDonald's"" (The scene they were making caused people to stare) They paid for their drinks and walked out. Now I can understand being hungry and wanting it to be tasty and warm. But this situation exuded disrespect to our town itself. This entire situation is entirely out of everyones control and to take it out on the waitress was uncalled for. 70,000 people were without power and had to eat somewhere! (Keep in mind that at least a 1/5 of the city's restaurants weren't even open due to the outages). Our waitress, Alicia was so kind and funny after having worked through the entire day. I applaud the entire staff at the Duluth, MN Applebee's tonight. If it weren't for the repetition of apologies that we heard around us I barely would have noticed how swamped, exhausted, and short-stocked you really were.

84917689333_10208429538370238,"I had an extremely horrid experience at the Jonesboro location on Tara Blvd. I almost feel like this location should be shut down because it's reputation in Atlanta proceeds it...but sadly...I did not know prior to doing research after my first and last experience there.  My sister, my spouse, and I went out to celebrate my spouse's birthday yesterday.  The service was horrible. Our waiter...a young man with an amazing beard who never introduced himself to us...was the worst server I've experienced anywhere in my life. We ordered a steak by the name printed on the menu and his response was that his mind debt work line that...that he didn't know what we were trying to order...and that we should have just called out the ounces of the steak and then he'd have known what we were trying to order.  He does not have the personality required for the service industry.  He was subjective, and would get upset when we would politely say things to him or ask him things.  He would disappear from his section for extended periods of time and return with nothing or little to nothing to explain his elongated absence. The table behind us grew impatient and demanded to be moved to another section. After continued poor service and more than an hour wait for appetizers, they brought out the 2 steak meals and both were wrong.  They added shrimp parm to one, and his response was if you're not allergic to shrimp then that's a plus for you...free shrimp. But she didn't want shrimp...she could easily have afforded it if she did. He didn't offer to take it back and she said it was fine because she didn't have the patience to wait an hour.  We waited for one of our non-alcoholic drinks for about 20 min. When my spouse's steak meal came out it was completely the wrong meal (1 steak not 2, no eggs, and also topped with shrimp parm) but with the sides that she ordered.  We explained that hers was wrong too. Our waiter said her food was in his hand and put down the steak and eggs, but with the wrong sides. She told him she didn't order that and explained that the plate with the wrong steak were the sides she ordered and our waiter argued with her that they weren't (but they were). He took it all back and brought it back out about 8 minutes later and it was cooked well, but she'd ordered medium-rare. At that time the waiter tells us he winged it with putting our order in. As we were still waiting for the steak to come back as ordered, I started eating my salad. Embedded down in the stack of lettuce was this dead fly. When I very calmly and politely explained how our night had gone to the manager, I told her a bug in my food was the final straw and we were leaving. I paid for our alcoholic beverages and appetizers because we'd consumed them. The manager then said the fly probably fell from the ceiling above me (no apology that I'd almost eaten a disease-ridden fly in their restaurant). I told her if it fell from the ceiling then it had to happen in the kitchen because lettuce, cheese, and croutons were on top of the fly.  Still without an apology, she took the plate, left the table, and sent a young woman over to deliver the bill for the drinks and apps. This was the worst dining experience of my life...and ruined my spouse's 31st birthday dinner.

84917689333_231082040596413,"Hello Everyone :-) 

This is an announcement about a FREE rebate app that I recently found, successfully used and really like.  It works at Applebee's, so I decided to share it here. 

Maybe you will like it too :-) 

I just this week started using this FREE rebate app, and just like they said, I got a $10 rebate bonus the very first time I used it - Just for trying it. You can too :-) 

Who can't use a gift of $10 just for trying a free rebate app right? 

Now when I go out to eat or do some grocery shopping, I search the app for rebates at the store or restaurant I'm going too - even while I'm in the store or restaurant. 

So, in addition to getting the $10 rebate bonus just for trying this FREE rebate app, I got another $0.50 rebate for buying a dozen organic eggs, and another $1.00 rebate for buying fruit and veggie popsicles and another $0.25 rebate for buying organic bananas. 

This seems like a good deal to me :-) 

So, if your in the mood, check out Ibotta to get a $10 bonus plus cash back from other purchases you'd be making anyway!

I love Ibotta  
Maybe you will too :-) 

Now I'm getting cash back almost everywhere I shop :-) Ibotta is offering rebates at hundreds of stores and restaurants and for many items I'd be buying anyway :-) 

Check it out or sign up 
to check it out at: 

https://ibotta.com/r/wulgdrv 

If it's not already pre-loaded, use the promotion code wulgdrv when you sign up in order to get the $10 rebate bonus when you start claiming rebates with this awesome free rebate app :-) 

May you be happy, 
May you be well, 
May you be safe, 

Namaste, love & gratitude, 

Richard

We always like eating at it because usually the food is great and the people that work there are awesome but yesterday I really can't say we had a great dinner. We started out with our drinks which were good as always and then placed our order. This is when everything went to crap. Our food came out wrong, burnt, and part of my dinner was on her plate and vise versa. Never has this happened. Mine went back once before they got it right. The wife's not so much. They were informed of a food allergy my wife has to mushrooms. Her food had to go back twice because of burnt food and mushrooms under her chicken. The manager was great! Made sure our food was prepared right before we got them. I guess what really pisses me off is when the bill came. I'm not one for wanting anything for free but to see my receipt is a slap in the face. If your going to comp the meal, don't basically say "" f that they are paying"" by taking the meal off the bill and then put it back on! This is making me not ever want to set foot back in this restaurant ever again!!

84917689333_10103525119139949,"I just had the most extraordinary experience at your location in Springfield, IL. We were traveling from St. Louis to Chicago when we stopped to grab something quick and stretch our legs. We have a 5 year old and an 8 week old. We had just been greeted by our server when I looked around for the diaper bag and realized it was still sitting where we left it back in St. Louis. I am the kind of mom who packs half of her life in her diaper bag with excruciating attention to detail. So, upon finding out we didn't have everything we needed for our journey, my exact reaction was not pretty. Not to mention, our youngest was wearing a pretty full diaper. My husband asked the hostess for directions to the nearest store, but I encouraged him to sit down, eat, and go to the store after our meal as everyone was starving and both kids were extremely cranky (as were we!) Shortly after our food arrived, our server walked up to our table and wordlessly dropped these two items on the edge. They had gone out and gotten us a full package of both diapers and wipes. She shared that she's a mom of four and she knows what is like to run out of what you need. The service and food were great, but this stranger's kindness is utterly remarkable. We appreciate you more than you will ever know, Kelly T. Thank you for assuring us that there are still wonderful people in this world.",,photo,https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10103525119139949&set=o.84917689333&type=3,2016-04-02 12:42:11,70,6,1

84917689333_10102984720523098,"just posted this to Yelp. This was the Blasdell NY location.

Absolutely awful experience and will never eat there again. My wife and I go there for a date night. This was supposed to be our buy one get one up to $20 our uncle gave us for Christmas. She ordered a quesadilla burger and I ordered shrimp wonton stir fry. Then the problems start. 

After about 15 minutes my wife's shows up. She receives her burger first. It's basically some lettuce and cheese one a tortilla, with a burger patty smaller than your typical whopper. She receives sweet potatoe fries, very few of them. Now bare in mind they charge like $12 for this, you'd get a bigger meal for $5 at Wendy's. Oh it's also cold. 

So time is ticking another 10 minutes. My order isn't there.  Waitress asks and I tell her I hadn't received my order. It shows up shortly after. I take two bites and there is a hair in it. I send it back. The manager comes over and asks me what I want. Offers to ring it up so I can still use my coupon (gee thanks) and offers a free dessert but I don't eat desserts I'm not a sweet tooth. So I said I guess I just want something else so order the cedar salmon.

So I'm sitting there sitting there, it's going on 20 minutes. I tell the waitress this is ridiculous and just pack it to go. So anyway the manager has the waitress comp the meal. Doesn't matter at this point because I didn't have the meal yet! So after this I'm still waiting for the meal, and I told my wife if it wasn't there in a few minutes we were just going to leave. At this point I'm just feeling bad about wasting the food, I'm angry,  they ruined our date night which we get few of and our Christmas gift from my uncle.

So the meal arrives in its to go bag, I leave. I get home to maybe 5 small cubes of potatos with a few spinach leaves and a tiny salmon steak, and by tiny I mean tiny. You could buy an equal size piece of salmon frozen at the dollar tree for $1. And they still wanted me to pay $15 for this! 

There are tons of good local restaurants that will treat you better than this, don't waste your time. Even if you get a gift certificate it might not be worth your hassle.",,photo,https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10102984720523098&set=o.84917689333&type=3,2016-03-31 21:05:13,2,8,0

So then my Father went to go pay and the original lady who took the order took payment but short changed my Father by $5.00 luckily my Father caught it and she didn't hesitate to give it back. So we get home and my Mom's hamburger was overlooked (see photo) and the tomato and lettuce was left off. My Cheeseburger was overlooked too but it doesn't bother me. So she had to throw her hamburger out and share my Fathers Hamburger Quesadilla with him. 

We will not be eating at Applebee's again. It was really disappointing especially since it was my birthday.

I scrolled thru the online menu and decided on this. It looked different and sounded good. What I received when I got home was nothing even close! It was very very cold and tasted more like a cold cut deli lunch wrap! I gave them the benefit of the doubt since it was take out, but then I saw that the cheese wasn't even partially melted and no sauce. I couldn't even finish half of the wrap. The wrap itself also tasted like raw read right out of the bag, it wasn't toasted or anything! It was so late I didn't even bother calling the restaurant as I was too tired to drive back out. If I was at the restaurant I would have sent the food back and I never do that. I have additional photos below of what it should be and what it actually looked like. I really hope this is not what your restaurants have dropped to.

84917689333_10209176559357716,"Last night's dining experience at the Applebee's in Lancaster, Pa ranks up there as the worst dining experience ever.  Waited 15 minutes for server to approach our table, ordered water and a glass of wine, water came, no wine, 10 minutes later wine arrives.  We placed our order which included an appetizer, soup and entrees.  My husband's entree was served 45 minutes after we arrived, looked like it had been dropped on the floor and was cold.  Also it arrived BEFORE the appetizer, the soup and my entree.  I commented to the server about his entree being served before the appetizer and soup and she shrugged her shoulders and said, they were all put in the kitchen....huh?  When she served my husband's cold entree I requested another glass of wine, 10 minutes after my husband's entree was served another person brought out the appetizer, COLD, the soup and my entree....another bit time passes and our original server comes back and and I have to remind her of the glass of wine I ordered....she says 'oh yea'....15 minutes later that finally arrives.  No dishes were cleared from our table.  The appetizer was served with 4 pieces of celery that were so thin you could see thru them and a minute offering of blue cheese. There wasn't even enough blue cheese  for the meager amount of celery.  My Thai salad consisted of literally 6 pieces of lettuce, some shrimp, about 10 edamame, maybe a teaspooon of sliced almonds and what appeared a cole slaw mix.  We were not alone, the table across from us were served their soup after an extended wait and had to request utensils, from 2 different people!!  Our check arrived, without even asking if we wanted dessert or anything else, which we didn't by now we were pretty fed up (no pun intended), and when it was brought back to us it was mixed up with another table's, the server handed us someone elses credit card!  The hosts and manager seemed oblivious to the issues going on as they chatted about personal issues and personel at the host stand.  In all we were there for over an hour and a half!  I really don't know what was worse, the service or the food.  From speaking with friends and family, this is not an unusual experience at this location.

Being said my husband and I decided that since our youngest daughter was turning five, we would go and have dinner at Applebee's.(Located at 1305 West Chester Pike, Havertown, PA)  As we received our appetizer, I took the dressing cup off my salad plate and found a broken piece of a glass cup underneath the dressing cup. I was sharing some of my salad with my daughter and she had almost eaten it. She could have gotten  seriously injured if she had. After the finding, we called the manager and she apologized immediately and offered to get us a new plate of food. But we were very disappointed. We could have gotten seriously injured. We were very lucky we had seen it. But this experience made both my family and I very upset.

The manager came and said that we would have to make a payment for those.I argued with him that why would I pay for it when I have already pre paid for it when I bought this promotion from Sams club. He charged me $15 which I paid. After that I asked the corporate number to which he said that they don't have corporate number. After that he left and did not return. After 5-10 mins a lady returned and said the same thing. Now my concern is, is that how a manager suppose to do? Run away from a situation? I bring a party of 15-20 to this Applebees every two months because I own a restaurant and I bring my employees here for some occasion. I need to know why Applebees selling such a card when the manager says they don't accept it for more than a $2 value.  I have paid for it already and now I have to pay for it again?

I got up myself and walked to the hostess stand to get silverware. . Server was shocked. So my steak..medium rare came out medium well. My husbands medium was well done. Our mixed veggies were raw.. he ate his steak.  I asked for a less cooked one. 20 mins later it arrived. I told them just box it up. My family was done. So they supposedly comp'd my steak.. and gave us free desert for the no silverware issue.. really explain the math here. Please. Im a Certified genius.....

I started to order from the Vet menu & the server RUDELY told me that was for the veteran. I told her I am the veteran & all she said was, ""oh well the host didn't say."" There was no ""I'm sorry"" just the blame passed. I was offended. I served our country honorably until I was injured.

My wife, Jill, was in the hospital for a month and they did a few different procedures. She was discharged and now her heart is 20% efficient. She still has a very long journey with lots of follow up appointments.

Verse 1
The world expect much from me..
But little do they know
the air around me....
Is harder...than ...stone
the years of my training...
Is longer...than thrones
life is not a bed of roses
for the captain on Boat.
Chorus
am captain Jack sparrow,
they dont even know(they dont even know)
i dont have a boat(i dont have a boat),
let alone to row(row row row)
but if i go...the crew will always cheers...
Captain Jack Sparrow, Captain Jack Sparrow
(short instrumental solo)
verse 2
is then I know is not about me
not having a boat...
But my willingness to row..(row row)
and take over the boat
decide which way to go..
Where the anchor can't longer hold,
is a duty life bestowed

Apparently Applebee's now has karaoke on Wednesday nights here. So there I was in what I thought was a family restaurant listening to inappropriate rap songs and watching highly suggestive videos on the largest screen in the restaurant. Bear in mind my daughters are 11 and 14, listening to curse words and watching almost naked women twerking or being dry humped on this big screen. I counted six curse words over the course of three songs. While not a big deal in a nightclub where it's to be expected, definitely not something I expect in a family establishment. Not to mention the fact that the music was so loud we literally couldn't hear each other talking. When I addressed my concerns with the manager, he stated this wasn't his restaurant, that he was just filling in. He stated he would talk to the dj and that his restaurant doesn't allow this type of vulgar music. Just curious Applebee's is this how you want your restaurants to be portrayed? I would think that you as an establishment would be better than this.",,video,https://www.facebook.com/gary.homer.9/videos/1025346784156962/,2015-08-05 22:00:20,2,9,0

84917689333_1451129041880337,"Together we can create ""A story with millions of your own adventure in it"". 
Hi there.
Do you ever read a very boring fiction?
Do you ever feel that you can easily guess the storyline?
Do you ever feel that the main character had made a mistake when making decisions?
Do you ever feel that the end of the story does not match your expectations?
Do you ever feel that you can make a better ending?
Do you ever feel that you can make a fictional story better than the story you are reading?
If one or all of the above answer is yes, then you can join us.
Together we can create ""A story with millions of your own adventure in it"". 
A story with millions of your own adventure in it - looking for readers, writers, ghost writers, authors, editors, reporters, journalists, bloggers, influencers, entrepreneurs, sponsors (funders) like you who want to help by giving $ 1 or more and spreading this campaign and the story to the world. 

With one dollar or more you can create a new entertainment industry and change the way you read a story. 
And every dollar you give to support this campaign I will return with perks worth tens, hundreds or even thousands of times.
This is a new entertainment industry you must know.
Try to imagine this. When you're reading a story on the website, you are given two choices. You can choose the next story based on your own choice. After selecting then you can continue reading the story. Shortly afterwards you will be presented back to the 2 other options. The next choice is up to you. Then you continue the story you are reading. After that you will be faced again with 2 choices. So onwards.

If you feel curious then you can re-read the story by changing your selection. Then you will see a different story with the story that you have read previously. The question now is why is this so? Because the storyline will be varying according to your choice. 


You might say like this. Sounds like a book ""choose your own adventure"". Books I read when I was young. Gamebooks are sometimes informally called choose your own adventure books or CYOA which is also the name of the Choose Your Own Adventure, a series of children's books published by Bantam Books. 
Correctly. The idea is taken from there. My story is the development of gamesbook. But I wrote a story much more interesting than the gamesbook because due to the limited number of pages. When a child first you may already feel interesting. But if you re-read the book now then becomes no fun anymore because you don't get anything with the amount of 80-200 pages. 
Choose your own adventure books or CYOA is evolving. CYOA evolved into MYOA or Millions of Your Own Adventure. Dont leave your friends behind. So  invite your friends to join us.
I, as the author (with your help) is planning to make tens of thousands of articles with millions of your own adventure in it. With tens of thousands of articles then you like to see a show of your favorite series on TV for several years. 
The difference is while watching your favorite TV series, then you can not change the story. Meanwhile, if you read this story then you can alter the way the story according to your own choice.
A story that I make (with your help) will surprise the world as made up of tens of thousands of articles with millions of your own adventure in it.
You are the main character in the story you are reading. So life and death, blessing and cursing, from the main character in the hands of you. 

With millions of your own adventure in it then you can be whatever you want according to the choice you make. 

You can be an entrepreneur. You can also become criminals. You can be a politician. You can be a pastor. You can also become a ghostbuster. So you become a success or a loser, it all depends on the choices you make.

Are you going to feel fun or cry, all depending on your choice. 

A good story can make us fun or cry, or make us discuss and argue with one another, because we can relate. A good story can help us see things in a new way. A good story can entertain us, enlighten us, and it can change us.

No where on the billboard does it specify it is only CERTAIN apps you get half priced. We get there, I order the bar appetizer of pickles. I understand the bar apps are going to be smaller than regular apps but only 7 pickles is pathetic. The flavor was good, however, some were mushy instead of crisp. Next I try to order my entree, the steak something or other hand-held. First on the list of hand-helds and was told they were out of the meat. Out of the meat on a Friday night. That's not a good sign. I tell waitress to put in everyone's orders while I decide on something else. Not once were we told only certain apps were half price and we went in thinking it was all. We only figured it out when we heard her tell the table behind us and the sloppy hand marked items in the menu. Poorly done. I decided to go with the salsa Verde nachos as my entree. They bring it out and there are chunks of iceberg lettuce all over it. Not strips chunks. Maybe five pieces of meat. Looked nothing like the photograph and was mediocre at best. I had to ask for a refill on water that was obviously empty. She brings it and sees the other water at the table is also empty. Does she ask if she needs a refill? No, my cousin has to ask. Also, one of the kids ordered a wrap with no bacon, comes with bacon. The four cheese macaroni, looked and according to what I was told, taste like barely one cheese. The waitress did make an attempt to make that right by bringing out an extra bowl of cheese for the macaroni. I think one time out of all the times I've tried Applebee's it has been good but every other time, does nothing but disappoint. The food never looks like the pictures and the service is always pitiful.",,photo,https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10101859038154496&set=o.84917689333&type=3,2015-07-25 10:00:54,14,8,0

As President of NAMI Rensselaer County who provides free support to Veterans families and Vets themselves (NAMI Homefront program, Peer to Peer, and Support Groups) this is very distressing.
I would like to present your side of the concern to our group and our vets and have this resolved PRESENTLY. We take our time and volunteer our time to support our vets with our own money and have mentioned your program, but have ceased noting Applebees until resolved.

84917689333_1080086815340002,"I was in the Lynwood Washington store tonight to celebrate a friend's 21st Birthday (she was turning 21 at midnight). 

When we got there we explained this to our waitress, who was then shown her ID. There did not seem to be a problem with it, at that time.

When 12am came and we ordered drinks, we were told she could not be served until the next business day. I knew this was wrong and asked to speak to the manager. In talking with the manager he informed me that they are trained to do this and tried telling me it was the Law. I explained that I have worked in the industry for decades, and that was not in the Law.

We ended up having to leave.  Luckily for us, the next place we went knew the Law, and served her her first legal drink, no thanks to Applebee's.

Needless to say, we won't be doing business with Applebees ever again.

By the way, here's the Law as described by Seattle Police.  You might like to teach your managers the Law, and not let them lie to their customers. And if you are training them in this manner, please stop, you nearly ruined a close friends 21st Birthday.

Idiots!

A: Seattle Police Department spokesman Drew Fowler consulted the state Liquor Control Board in clarifying the answer.

Basically, he said, a person is of legal drinking age at the stroke of midnight on his or her birthday.

In other words, if your birthday is on the 20th, you can spend the evening of the 19th being responsible and drinking celebratory tea (thats what people do, right?) until midnight, when you can begin your law-abiding drinking of adult beverages.

I ordered the 4 cheese Mac n cheese with the honey glazed chicken tenders and this is what I received. Now, I've had this plate  several times within the last 3 months, but never have I've ever received chicken bites that were suppose to be ""chicken tenders"". So they basically threw chicken bites or chicken nuggets on top of my dish. So naturally I call the manager over and this is what he brings me (2nd photo to follow post) to correct the size of the chicken bites that were presented as chicken tenders. I am a frequenter visitor of Applebee's but after today I'm not sure if I shall take my business elsewhere. I can on longer about how long the service was for us to get our food because ""the cooks messed up several orders so our dishes will take longer than usual"" at least that's what the waitress told us. Then the Women's restroom was totally and completely filthy. I can go on forever . This was at the Bayshore Town Center location in Milwaukee, Wi.

Cut to a size that makes them more snackable than Applebees traditional Riblets
Were thrilled to push the envelope and introduce new flavorful and tender Crosscut Ribs, said Darin Dugan, Applebees Senior Vice President of Culinary and Marketing.

August 18, 2014
Applebees, Americas favorite neighborhood grill and bar, is reinventing an American classic with the introduction of Crosscut Ribs, a new street cuisine-inspired, no-utensils-necessary way to devour the most tender, meaty bone-in cuts of pork loin the brand has ever offered.

Cut to a size that makes them more snackable than Applebees traditional Riblets or Baby Back Ribs, Crosscut Ribs are best eaten by hand (with plenty of towelettes at the ready!) after being slow-cooked and slathered with one of three original Applebees sauces: new Sweet Asian Chile, new Smoky Chipotle or classic Honey BBQ.
	Sweet Asian Chile: Applebees sweet, spicy sauce with the flavors of soy, ginger, red chile and garlic.
	Smoky Chipotle: A sweet sauce infused with the smoky flavors of chipotle and ancho peppers.
	Classic BBQ: The sweetness of honey meets the classic taste of BBQ.
Were thrilled to push the envelope and introduce new flavorful and tender Crosscut Ribs, said Darin Dugan, Applebees Senior Vice President of Culinary and Marketing. You pair these ribs with one of our new sauces and its such an unbeatable combination, you dont want to be the last person to try them.
For a limited time, Applebees Guests can try all three delicious sauces with All-You-Can-Eat Ribs, served with new crispy BBQ-spiced fries and creamy coleslaw, and share their rave reviews using the hashtag #CrosscutRibs on social media.
Perfect Swigs for Each Round of Ribs
As the summer season winds down, Applebees rounds out its bar offering with a new lineup of cocktails featuring popular drinks perfect for kicking off fall and rib-eating season. These drinks put a modern twist on the classics and are handcrafted to satisfy every palette.

Everytime I have ordered takeout here, I've been disappointed.  This time takes the cake.  There was no heat and there were electric heaters all over the place.  I was told the heat had been broken since Saturday.  I ordered a green goddess wedge salad to go.  The picture below shows what I received.  A wedge of BROWN, mushy lettuce with strips of bacon on it.  I've ordered this in the restaurant before to eat in and never had an issue.  Everytime I order take out, the food is terrible.  It's obvious the kitchen and staff doesn't care about your takeout customers.  I'm done with this location as my complaints to management there before have obviously fallen on deaf ears.

Review of Applebees in Warrenton VA.
I won't bother putting up pictures it was a disaster. My little boy had a rough day at school, and wanted to go somewhere to eat so, we popped in there as it is close by, and on the way home. It is also meant to be half price for kids on Tuesday, and being kids they often just want chicken nuggets and corn dogs. The wait staff were fine seated us on a table that wobbled. The crowd at the bar were already drunk at 3:30 pm in the afternoon, and we could here the F bomb being shouted where we sat by the window, on the rocking table 20 feet away. They have a new pub menu, I ended up ordering a drink and an appetizer of mini sliders. The kids ordered chicken nuggets and fries, and the corn dog & fries. It took a while for the food to come out, when it did the corn dog was frozen. The manager came by and apologized and they said they would be out with another soon. The second round came out and yes again the corn dog was frozen in the middle. Manager came by again apologized had nothing to really say for the fact the cooks can't cook. They took my daughter's kids meal off the bill still charged me full price for mine and my sons. I won't be back and again this reiterates to me the poor standards of chain restaurants in our area. I'll be letting Applebees know. My advice stay clear.

84917689333_1024110107606323,"Today, I ordered online through Applebee.com's website and purchased an order for takeout. Needless to say, my photos show how the food really is when it's served to you in ""real life"" versus the misrepresentation reflected in the photos of their food on their website.
For lack of better words, I am deeply disappointed and would not come back to this Applebee's location again, and possible never again to Applebee's period.
In brief, my steak was cold and undercooked (completely pink in the inside, although I put in my order to have it well-cooked with a HINT of pink). Likewise, the stuffed mushroom was very watery and, again, cold. My salad was disgusting....just look at it yourself. Does this look appetizing?! The chefs usually real Grade A bagged salad mix......I sure feel that I got my whole $11.49's worth!
Lastly, as shown below, I ordered one ""Strawberry cheesecake shooter"" and one ""Hot fudge sundae shooter""; however, this is not what was included in my order (see below). Secondly, I asked for whipped cream for both, yet I got only one small container for the two desserts and the whipped cream was already melted and about the same consistency as soup by the time of when I arrived at the restaurant.
This is a horrible experience and if this is a direct reflection of the new Applebee's, BOY have they sure gone down hill!",,photo,https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=1024110107606323&set=o.84917689333&type=3,2015-01-25 16:51:48,0,4,0

84917689333_1548523308759866,"I/we had the worst experience at our local Apple Bees. There was 4 adults and 4 children. The light above our table was out. Our waitress didn't even care. A different waitress tried to get it working by tapping on it. Both me and my wife ended up getting headaches over it. The waitress, Penny Antrim, was rude and disrespectful to all of us. She had a problem with one of the women in our party and took it out on all of us. Then to top it off. She posted on a website called New Castle Topixs. I will post a link at the end of this post. I know with out a doubt that none of us will go back to Apple Bees while she is still employed there. I can not even begin to express how bad of a waitress she was or how she treated us. I am ashamed that the children had to witness that type of behavior. Luckily they are too young to have had to read about it as well. I hope the appropriate measures are taken to ensure that no one else has to endure her nasty behavior. She is a disgrace to Apple Bees and especially a disgrace to New Castle. People like that should never be allowed to work with the public.

It was gratifying to me to see how the readers of my comments would reactthey are ALL very positive and agree that Denise was something special and an angel on earth

The responses were literally world wide (Africa, England, Scotland, Ireland, Germany and coast to coast) and for the most part reflect comments of care givers past and present or victims of Alzheimers or one of the dementia diseasesone was from my sister in law Lynda in Rice Lake, WI and the last one was from my Nephew Jauhn in Green Bay, WI who said he loved it

Of course there is always that segment of readers who say nothing

I am passing the comments on to Denise so that she can also see how loved she is by everyone

A friend very dear to my heart lost her fiance on Nov 26th, 2014. Her name is Valerie Fee, though she prefers Allie/Mom. She is 31 years old, lives in Quakertown, PA has two amazing children, Julianna, 8 and Frankie Jr., 3. 
In an unexpected moment we all pray to never have to experience, she has instantly gone from a happy-go-lucky stay at home mom to a widow, who now has to make a million ends meet while instantly filling both parental roles. She is also the type of person who through life experience,  typically doesn't ask for help. I see a million of these type of fundraisers based off of people trying to raise money for a variety of awesome goals, usually functions that one like myself could never afford - and by all means I am not trying to take away from that - but I feel like this cause is far more important than any civic event.. We're just a few days before Christmas as we start this, and I am asking anyone that has ever known me, or does know me.. If you can give ANYTHING, please, consider it the most flat out purchase of karma you've ever come across. I have never known anyone dealt a more difficult hand in life, only to be determined make the best of it and give her kids better, and finally in turn losing her partner and love of her life so early in their kids lives.. May your generosity come back to you in your moment of tribulation, and God bless you. Thank you from the bottom of my heart, regardless of denomination. I know every dollar helps her and her beautiful children. Merry Christmas and Happy holidays to you all, and God Bless!

84917689333_10100810093154088,"My experience and 20 other that agree per my Facebook comments about the quality of As they named crapplebees. 

On the way home from the horse show we decided to place a Togo order with Applebee's because they offer curbside Togo.  (I had no right to go in public after the show) 

Phillip placed the order online at 6:24 pm. The website allowed a choice of inside or curbside pickup and the receipt clearly shows he choose curbside.

Having been a sever, I know Saturday nights are busy and I made one other stop before going to the restaurant. 

By the time I arrived at the restaurant, there was another vehicle in one of the Curbside slots. The body language of these people suggested they were agitated and I assumed the to go host was a little slow with their order. 20 more minutes passed before the other passenger stormed into the store and returned with her order. By this point her body language read ""angry.""
 
At 7:15 I decided to go in to check on my order. The host told me that to go orders are part of the bar's duties. 
(I admit, I was a bit upset at this point.) 
I walked to the bar and informed the tender that I'd placed my order almost an hour earlier and it still hadn't been brought out. She informed me that the store does not offer Curbside service on weekends. So, I asked if the store had a means of informing customers about this detail since our order clearly had Curbside marked. Her response was, ""Well, if you called in the order, you would have known.""

Now, I was really fighting to not lose my cool. As I said, I used to be a server, and I'm really good at biting my tongue. According to the receipt, I got the food at 7:21 and I promptly left. (Because of the online payment, the bar tender already had a 15% tip.)
 
When I got home, it was clear the food had sat under a heat lamp for 30 minutes. Also, I had ordered a salad, which they tossed the dressing on before placing under the lamp. (Yummy, soggy salad.)

Phillip ordered a steak, cooked medium, and paid $1.49 extra for mushrooms. If you take a peek at the pictures, you can see what awaited us when we opened the boxes.

I really hope that ""Angie"" does not work at the Applebee's on Fordham Rd in the Bronx. This video of her is truly disgusting! Now it does not state the location, however many ppl on FB who are native to the Bronx have already confirmed the location, based on footage in this video. If this is a fake video I would highly suggest Applebee's go after whoever made it. And if it's authentic I highly suggest a public apology as well as confirmation that this waitress/hostess or whatever her title may be, has been fired. If she is truly an employee and she has given a false name, it wouldn't be hard to figure out who she is with this video. This video is circulating FB and many blogger sites.

84917689333_10152705968074643,"I also sent an email to the Contact Us link on the website, but the 1500 character limit just wasn't enough for the terrible visit we had (why put a limit on it anyways?  People need to clearly get information across.  I think communication is a HUGE issue in your stores, and this just proves why!)

Very disappointed in Applebees once again (Fort Wayne, IN Clinton Street).  My family of 5 went on 9-13.  I had a birthday coupon and wanted to try it out again, hoping things had changed.  

We waited over 30 minutes for our food, and it finally came after we asked for it.  Our server, Tanya C. was great, but the manager, Sheila, was terrible.  We asked Sheila about our food 30 minutes after we'd ordered, and she said it should only take about 15 minutes, and since it had been so long she'd check on it.  She left and never came back to tell us it would be so many minutes or to ask if it was ok once we got it.  

When we did get the food, it was COLD, lukewarm at best.  And it wasn't just one thing, everything was like this.  I had the onion steak (medium rare) with smashed crispy potatoes, sauteed mushrooms (supposed to be in a bowl on the side) and broccoli, husband had steak (medium rare) with mashed potato and baked potato, daughter 1 and 3 each had steak (one medium and one medium rare) with applesauce, daughter 2 had chicken fingers and french fries.  

In addition to being COLD, there were several other issues.  My steak came out without the potato or the onion, and it was cooked medium well.  Also the mushrooms were so salty (and cold) they were inedible.  They also came on the same plate as my steak, and I asked for them in a bowl on the side because I don't like the juice from my food running together.  My husband's baked potato was forgotten.  Daughter 1 steak was cooked very rare, like just seared and thrown on the plate.  

We asked to see the manager, as we were flabbergasted at all the issues.  I can understand one or two things being wrong, but this was the WHOLE MEAL.  We explained it and also explained that we didn't have time to wait *another* 30 minutes for our food.  My husband did eat his mashed potatoes and steak because he was starving after having worked all day and only had oatmeal for breakfast and a couple peanut butter sandwiches for lunch.  Daughter 1 ate her steak.  Everything else was left untouched.  

Sheila left with the check and came back and announced ""I was able to get it down to $12 for ya, is that OK?"" and smiled.  No, it's not ok, since the food was terrible, and we didn't eat it.  But whatever, I don't have time to argue.  I paid the $12 and we left the server a good tip because the service WAS good.  The food sucked!  And we did NOT take anything home.  Boxes weren't even offered until after the manager took the money off the bill, and saw how upset I was.  I wanted to make the point that the food was bad.  Hopefully it worked.  

I had to stop at McDonalds on the way home and spent $14 on food there because my kids and I were hungry.  I should not have to stop at another restaurant on the way home from a restaurant because the food was so bad we couldn't eat it.  We had a 25 minute drive from McDonald's to home, and the food was HOTTER from McDonalds when we got home than it was at Applebee's when we were there!  

Get it together Applebee's!  We have stopped coming because of crap like this.  This is the WORST visit we have ever had.  I really do want to use my birthday coupon, but at this point I'm wondering if I'll be able to.  

I have attached photos of the receipts to this post, showing that we were at Applebee's, and that we stopped at McDonald's 6 minutes after we paid our bill.",,photo,https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10152705968074643&set=o.84917689333&type=3,2014-09-15 07:28:00,0,7,0

Guns take 30,000 American lives each yearincluding 8 children per day and wound
70,000 each year50 each day are children. That is not OK.
All that is necessary for a gun epidemic to triumph in America is for corporate America to stay on the sidelines and do nothing.

they ordered from the 2 for $20 menu the Bourbon Street Chicken & Shrimp. They liked it so much and the next time we came they insisted that I should order it as well, but from a regular menu. I checked the menu and was very disappointed - for the same Bourbon Street Chicken & Shrimp  and salad I would have to pay $20 for 1 person, when my sister has the same for $20 for 2.
It felt like discrimination for being without a partner. It was like another painful reminder about my loss.
Couldn't it be 2 for $20 or 3 for $30? It is hard to go to the restaurant alone, but when I'm going with friends, should I still be reminded that I can't have the same prices as a couple?
There is so many positive things in your restaurant, but a minor mistake can ruin everything.

84917689333_10203223208354447,"Dear Applebees,

Since there is no email address provided for anyone in your company, and you don't respond to the web form you provide, or to snail mail, I'm posting here. I wish the world did not have to share in our conundrum -  but you've forced my hand...

Im writing to see if you received my complaint a few months ago outlining the concerns I had with my full order of ribs that I purchased for both myself and my son - who was home on leave from the United States Army at the time. I brought these concerns regarding our dinner to the manager on duty back in December, since then I've been eagerly awaiting a reply; from anyone 

(You can pre-record a cat talking and call me, at least then Ill know that my complaint was acknowledged, just please dont turn him into a baby back rib dinner afterwards, which I suspect is what my son and I tried to consume while last patronizing your establishment).

First, Id like a little clarification please if I may?

Please confirm which animal the ribs came from. I dont mean which animal specifically, just the species. I've thought about this long and hard and Im convinced they must have belonged to a cat, or one of the Olsen twins - probably Mary Kate.

To be honest, what was presented as a ""meal"" didn't hit the mark; not even close. I've seen meatier ribs in a World Vision Hunger commercial.

Your commercialism gives an impression of grandeur and quality regarding your food choices. You also appear to have a new slogan see you tomorrow. Because of this, I was expecting to be presented with a rack of ribs similar in size to the one that tips Freds car over during the opening sequence of The Flintstones. I also thought that perhaps I would dine with your establishment tomorrow.

Unfortunately, what I received looked more like Skeletors throne from He-Man and the Masters of the Universe - a childhood favorite cartoon of mine, although Skeletors throne was comparatively not burnt to a crisp and covered in BBQ sauce in order to hide that fact. His throne is also not using the bones of a small cat. I also did NOT dine in your restaurant tomorrow
 

Dont you think that for someone named Skeletor, hes incredibly muscular? 
Me too.

Remember the movie Gladiator, starring Russell Crowe? Its probably my favorite sports movie of all time. Basically, its about Rustys experience at the Coliseum. He gets really angry and kills lots of people in it, a scene Ive played out in my mind countless times over the last couple of months after thinking about my dining experience and my interaction with the manager and chef at my Applebees in Grants Pass. Dont worry though; Im not a violent person. At worst Id probably just throw a telephone at you - another one of Mr. Crowes favored combat techniques.

The one positive outcome from this experience is that Im thinking of sponsoring a World Vision Hunger child. I havent done much research into this yet - do I get to bring him home? If so, Id probably go for one with a bit of sweatshop and/or tailoring experience. Im terrible with a sewing machine, and since I lost so much weight - a consequence of meager rib consumption - I now require a skilled tailor to alter all my clothes. What do you think I should name the little guy? Im thinking, Maximus.

Im not after an apology, but I do want you to know that after the exorbitant amount of money I paid for the replica graveyard of bones and cobwebs covered in ut-oh BBQ sauce you gave us, could have been used to keep little Maximus and his family alive for a quarter of a millennium, which just happens to be the same amount of time itll take me to reconsider ordering from you again, especially after not hearing from you for so long, and being told in the restaurant I was going to pay for our meal regardless of MY determination of poor quality.

All the best,

84917689333_10203112381122320,"I just wanted to share my experience at the Applebee's in Raytown, Missouri on Saturday night.  My girls decided to be goofy and wore some goofy outfits.  They are teenagers and have been having problems with some depression.  I decided to allow them to accompany us for a family dinner to this location to be good natured and supportive of them and their creativity.  Keep in mind, we generally go to this location once a week or at least bi-weekly (5-7 of us) and sit in the bar area where the kids sit at one table and my fianc, his brother and I sit at another table to smoke and that way it doesn't bother them.  We spend generally $60-$80 there and are friends with the server Dottie.  I normally participate in the surveys and give them excellent ratings, but the last 2 times we have gone have been a disappointment.  The second to the last time, we were told a 15 minute wait because there were no clean tables (not true, we could see clean tables).  Then the server (whom I felt took advantage of us being regulars said that she knew we would be patient while she got some of the tables their food, so the kitchen wasn't back logged with orders).  Finally, 45 minutes later we were seated.  This was the first weekend of May, so with the Cinco de Mayo specials a lot of the appetizers we order were sold out by the time we were seated.  Saturday when we went, we were told a 10 minute wait, once again no clean tables (again false), then the manager (whom I have spoke with several times and normally recognizes us) came and asked if at least one of us was over 21 (thank you for the compliment, however, I just turned 35 and you have carded me previously when I ordered margaritas).  I felt this was discriminatory because of the way my kids were dressed and this upset me.  Told another 10 minutes by the manager.  A few minutes later the bartender/server for the smoking area, told us another 15 minutes or so.  I assumed someone else would come out and tell us another 10-15 minutes the way it was going.  When we finally ordered and were situated, we heard the bartender/server getting upset with the dishwasher because she was the only server and bussing all the tables in the smoking area and the dishwasher was complaining about all the dishes she was bringing back.  She apologized for her outburst about the dishwasher.  This location in the last 2 month has had one fight that Dottie told us about and another fight outside the Carside to Go area that we were present for.  We always tip well, never cause any issues and yet, this is how you repay our loyalty?  We went to 54th Street Bar and Grill tonight, had excellent food, a 20 % off coupon, half price appetizers and drinks after 9 pm (same as you) and we were treated respectfully (this is also closer to my house).  So instead of doing YET another survey, where I may or may not get my crappy $10 gift card (I didn't get one when I complained about my wings being raw, but the manager-the same one that questioned if I was over 21-gave me the $10), we will probably just start going to 54th Street, where they are not understaffed, appreciate our business and don't have the unnecessary entertainment you have......Good luck keeping that location open....",,photo,https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10203112381122320&set=o.84917689333&type=3,2014-05-26 03:11:07,3,5,1

I just had the loveliest evening with one of my top three WORST dining experiences ever. Starting off, it was really great to wait 40 minutes for a table, when this VERY same table has sat like this before, during, and after my arrival. When receiving our food, half the food was missing and we would be assured that they were ""making the fries fresh"". Half an hour later, I acknowledged it AFTER we finished our meal, and staff and management was nonchalant about it. I think the MOST frustrating part about this, wasn't for myself, but for the table next to us. They were seated a good 20 minutes before us, but we received and finished our food before they even got their appetizers. I'm actually still sitting at the table right now with zero offers of a drink refill, and a barren table for 20 more minutes (food---or the half I did received was finished then).

 My name is Bryce Amdur, I am 26 Years old. I served nearly 5 years in the United States Army. I was Medically discharged in February 2013. I am Racing in the Spartan Race To show myself and other veterans that no matter what, We can and we will come back through the hell we have gone through. I am racing all 3 of the Spartan Race events throughout the year of 2014 in order to receive what they call the Trifecta Medal. I have teamed up with the Wounded Warrior Project in order to personally raise $100,000 Dollars for the WWP by the time I finish my Trifecta Challenge on October 25,2014 in Sacramento, California. I want to help the WWP in order to assist them in everything they do for our Veterans who return home with challenges from War. It is not an easy road and they need our support. Us as Americans need to be Thankful for our veterans and help them reintegrate back into civilian life. Please go to the link bellow and send whatever you can, weather it be $1, $5, $10 whatever you can to help me reach my goal and to help the WWP keep doing the amazing work they do for our War Veterans.

84917689333_294962410672542,"The average length of a hug between two people is 3 seconds. But researchers have discovered something fantastic. When a hug lasts 20 seconds, there is a therapeutic effect on the body and mind. The reason is that a sincere hug produces a hormone called ""oxytocin"", also known as the love hormone. This substance has many benefits in our physical and mental health, helps us, among other things, to relax, to feel safe and calm our fears and anxiety. This wonderful calming is offered free of charge every time we have a person in our arms, who cradled a child, we cherish a dog or cat, we're dancing with our partner, the closer we get to someone or just hold the shoulders of a friend.

84917689333_786903977989374,"Hello, my name is Nicholas Bishop I am 20 years old and a local from Youngstown Florida. I listen to you guys all the time and I wanted to send a message to share my story. I have a disease called Charcot-Marie Tooth disease which is characterized by loss of muscles tissue and touch sensation, predominantly in the feet and legs but also in the hands and arms in the advanced stages of the disease. This disease is not well known because it is rare but does effect 37 out of 100,000 people. The FDA does not support stem cell research in the United States which is why I need help in raising money so I can go to Mexico and have the treatment. Stem cell research is approved in Mexico and several other countries across the globe. I wanted to send you guys a message to help me raise the money I need by creating awareness over the radio and sharing my link to your audience. I know in life people come across hardships and challenges every day, but as a young man I am passionate about getting this disease known, not only to help myself but to help other people across the globe that are affected. Anything you could do would be greatly appreciated.

Thank you,
Nicholas Bishop

I am very upset with the standards at this location that they would send food out to a paying customer looking like this. Aside from the piece of salmon there was almost nothing in my container and I was still hungry afterwards. Is this how they would have served it to me if I was eating in the restaurant? I would hope not. Bad business.,,photo,https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10100738546953098&set=o.84917689333&type=3,2014-02-28 11:43:30,0,8,0

Restaurant information:
     United States of America, New York State, Fresh Meadows, 
     61-48 188th Street

        Time of visit: 09:05 pm
Manager visit table: NO

Issue:

The food tasted pretty good, but nothing special. The service was a little slow considering it wasn't that busy and Kimberly didn't seem too interested in being at work that night. She didn't even introduce herself.

No bread, or something to knosh on, was provided while we were waiting to order, or waiting for the food to arrive. It's a small gesture that says ""Welcome, friends!"" and ""Tank you for patronizing our establishment."" I'm not sure if it was an oversight on Kimberly's part, the manager's, or Applebees policy. I did not ask, but, admitedly, it felt unusual because all of the other restaurants I visit always provide something. I strongly believe it is a nice touch, and brings forth a sense of friendliness. No such feelings were felt at Applebees. The atmosphere was so cold we might as well have been in Alaska.

However, when time came for coffee I got a rather rude awakening: with TWO mugs of coffee we were each given TWO 1/2 ounce(?) creamer cups! Really? When I asked for more she bought over ONE container for EACH of us! The coffee hardly changed to the light color I like. I asked if this was the manager's policy, and she responded ""yes."" I asked for more creamer & ****eventually**** she bought over a hand full of creamer cups PLUS a small glass of milk. In the meantime the coffee cooled off and she NEVER asked to replace it with warm coffee. Bitchy move, don't you think? Yet, she expected a decent tip! Do you think that attitude made a loyal customer? I think not!

What nerve to charge $3.00 for a mug of coffee and only supply 1 oz of creamer per mug of coffee, and an attitude from your staff! Are you kidding me?

I understand Applebee's is an International company, and this complaint will not mean much and most likely ignored, but I want 
Facebook users to know how uncaring Applebee's is and what to expect from such a huge company.

Worse, on my way out I noticed some safety issues outside the restaurant. 1) a basement door is damaged but NO protection is afforded pedestrians. And, 2) on the other side of the building there is a molding  that is sticking out from the wall, but because of a barrier it doesn't present danger to pedestrians. Enclosed are copies of the photos I took that night.

84917689333_10202182324653475,"I'd like to complain about the terrible service that my coworkers and I received at the Applebee's on 2389 Lakeland Drive Flowood, MS 39208 on January 26, 2014. My coworkers and I work in retail, so we know how to treat customers, unfortunately our waiter, who's name on the receipt is Kristopher C, did not. It took him 15 minutes to take our drink orders, then about 35 minutes to take appetizer orders then when we asked if we could finally order food and if there was a problem (he was short with us and rude from the moment we sat down) he blew up on us. He began to yell at us, told us that we were rude, and how I waved menu in his face as if he ""wasn't even a human being"". When we called the manager over, I believe her name is Camrien, she said that he would be pulled from the floor tonight and no longer working, even though he was still working by the time we left, but while she was talking to us Kristopher was yelling at our table from the opposite side of the restaurant, he was also complaining about how he has 3 other tables, but isn't that a waiters job? To work multiple tables at once? I'm so dissatisfied with the service and management at this location that I never want to eat at ANY Applebee's anywhere. I don't believe that this issue has been taken car of so I'm writing this to you guys so that you could take care of it.

84917689333_10200828373260181,"So I was at my local Applebee's for dinner with my bf, Daniel Mc Dougal. I ordered their new menu item called the 4-cheese Mac & cheese with chicken strips. I have ordered this in the past and it was served to me with UN-COOK bacon! It was replaced during that visit and the item was taken off my bill. I decided to try it again with the hopes that it would be good like the replacement was. Low-and behold, it was once again served with UN-COOKED bacon. When I showed the manager he achknowleged the bacon was not cooked, quickly took the plate with the promise of a freshly cooked meal. I wasn't hungry anymore and had the meal boxed up.

When I received my bill the total was over $27.00. 

Here is the breakdown:

2 for $24
2 iced teas $2.99 ea
% discount -$4.80
1 Mac & Cheese discount -$11.99

If you do simple math and add it up the total comes to $13.19 BEFORE tax. If you add sales tax (9%) you come to a total of $14.38!!!! But yet the total came to OVER $27!!! Wth!?!? So I asked for the manager and he came over and argued with me that the bacon WAS cooked and that he had to charge me for another meal and only discounted the one meal!!! I told him that wasn't acceptable since I wasn't able to eat the replacement meal. He said that he would adjust the discount further. The picture attached is what he adjusted the bill which STILL doesn't add up correctly!!! Please everyone look at this and check it out!!! Please tell me if I'm wrong!!!",,photo,https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10200828373260181&set=o.84917689333&type=3,2013-12-10 23:45:51,0,10,0

I have been going to applebees consistently for the past 8 yrs at least once a month. I even have my bday parties there with at least 20 to 40 people every yr. I am usually at 59th ave and Peoria, 99 and northern, 75th and Bell rd, or rural rd and Broadway. Me and my soon to be wife decided to stop here at this applebees (bell canyon pavillions on I 17 and bell rd). We get a table and order a beer....   And wait.... And wait... And wait.... Finally we get our beers 20 mins later. We drink those and order another.... And wait and wait and wait.... 15 mins later we got the beers. Then we had no menus and were wanting food. When she finally came around again our beers had been gone for at least 10 mins. Me and my girl decided were not eating so I asked for a check. And wait and wait and wait... I was about to walk out and say applebees can eat this bill. But my girl did not let me. So finally the bill comes around and I pay and don't ask me why the hell I left a tip but I did. This was the worst experience I have ever encountered at applebees. Me and my girl were going out to eat tonight I asked her where? Her reply.. not applebees. Now I would never even take my time to wright this out but it bothers me knowing it bothered her.

84917689333_10201301589134460,"Last Friday night I went out with a bunch of friends to Applebees. I ordered shrimp lemon fettuccine, no tomatoes. After having to tell the waitress once about the tomatoes, she brought me back what I thought was a new plate, but instead they just stirred everything up to make it look like there weren't any tomatoes. Thank goodness I am not allergic to them. After telling the waitress a second time I was told they were making me a brand new plate. A few seconds later of sifting through my current plate I came across whats pictured in the photo. This piece of metal is about 1 1/2 inches long  the way it currently sets, and I barely noticed it wrapped up in the pasta. It's a good thing I had to pick at my food. I will never eat at Applebees again. Could you imagine if this had gotten stuck in my teeth, tore my mouth, or if it had actually made it down my throat? And of course all I got from the management was a half-assed apology while they tried to get the piece of metal out of my hands. I was offered a free dessert and my meal comped, but after having been served this I wont eat another thing at your restaurants and I will be sure to pass this around for others to see. Oh and yes I have already emailed the company, but I think this should be posted here as well.",,photo,https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10201301589134460&set=o.84917689333&type=3,2013-09-04 18:18:51,6,8,1

Please think about it and get back to me . Thank you. Love your biggest fan

84917689333_692938637386174,"We want to say a BIG thank-you to our neighborhood Applebee's on Nicholasville Road! Our son, John Wayne, who plays for South Lexington Youth Baseball, declared a long time ago that Applebee's is his favorite restaurant. We began the tradition of visiting Applebee's whenever he gets a home run.  It all began at one game when as he was going up to bat, I told him from behind the fence at home plate that we'd ""...go to Applebee's...now DO IT!"" He did it--a homerun--and the tradition was born. Thereafter, at many more up to bats, his teammates from the dugout would chant ""Applebee's, Applebee's, Applebee's"" to encourage him on. His 5th homerun was hit and celebrated at Applebee's during the spring season this past May. The Applebee's staff was incredible making our celebration a great one. Today at our first Fall Ball Season game with ""Applebee's, Applebee's, Applebee's"" echoing from his SLYB Black Stallion teammates in the dugout, he achieved his 2nd career GRAND SLAM! We, of course, had to visit our most favorite Applebee's! We had our table visited by the restaurant manager, he was congratulated by our great server, was high-fived by the bartenders, and was served a celebratory ice cream. Thanks so much, everyone at Applebee's on Nicholasville Road, for celebrating with us! Hope to be back SOON!",,photo,https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=692938637386174&set=o.84917689333&type=3,2013-08-25 16:31:12,3,1,0

My husband finished his meal and finally have her come back and she realizes I never got the garlic potatoes and I tell her about my meat. I refused them to put it back on the grill and I wanted my check. Yes I got my meal for free I only ate a little broccoli and the shrimp.

The manager told our server that the $2 off other burgers was a misprint do we couldn't order the burgers we wanted. We didn't it was fair to us and she should've honored the menu price as well remove the menus and not hand them out if they're wrong. They kept handing them out to other customers and didn't let us get the burgers we wanted. Just sent an email to Applebee's headquarters about the situation.

The waitress made a scene and refused to serve their table due to something that happened between people not even at your restaurant.  My cousin and her party were mortified.  The manager didn't do much to rectify the situation.  Employees should not ""act out"" on the job.  If she didn't want to wait on their table, fine but Ms. Pittman should have handled that quietly.

84917689333_10151308365324334,"Me and my family just had a horrible experience at Applebees in Huber Heights, Ohio! We waited at our table for 15 mins before anyone even came to the table to ask for our drinks. Finally the waitress came over to take our drink order & food order. When she bought back the drinks they were in small styrofoam cups because she said they didnt have any clean. Eventually 30-45 mins. later she brought regular plastic cups. Then as we waited for our food that took forever and when she brought out the food she walked away and never gave us silverware. I had to waive her down to ask if we could have silverware, she said well I dont know if we have any clean right now, but I will check. Well they did, but she just handed it to us wrapped in a big stack of napkins and they were extremely cold and nasty. She only checked on us once and was doing whatever else she was doing. My husband had to go to the car with my daughter who was 1 1/2 because she was starting to get cranky, so my son and I stayed and tried to finish our food. Well he got choked on a corn dog and I jumped up and walked over to him , beating on his back and raising his arms in the air. The tables around me just sat there and staired as Im doing this. ( Not that they had to do anything because I had it under control, but I just figured someone would at least ask if hes ok)!  I became very frustrated and just  wanted to get my food and bill and just go because it was a horrible experience. WELL again I couldnt find my waitresss, finally I seen her accross the room, so I hd to walk to her to get my bill and 2 boxes to go. As a family of 4 and (2 small kids) my husband and I dont take the kids out very often because we dont have the extra money. I was really hoping for great service and a nice relaxing meal.

The problem was: we never received email with the promised free app from your website for his birthday. I asked-the waitress said she didn't know about this offer(I believe to be added to newsletter-will get free app on bday).  Our main issue was that we were informed at 7pm and again at 8pm that gift cards were unable to be processed last night. We were there nearly two hours-I find it hard to believe this problem could not be fixed in that amt. of time.

84917689333_10151301701949334,"I wanted to share the story of what happened to my family when we were at the Applebees in St. Cloud, MN last week on Tuesday. We were there to celebrate my fathers 63rd birthday when the night started out poorly from the beginning. First our waitress waited an unusually long time to just take our drink order. Then we waited again as long to actually receive our drinks. The appetizer actually arrived before our drinks. Obviously it took forever for our food to get to our table and when it did, it was cold. My alfrdeo dish was also dry and my mom didnt even get the soup she had ordered. We explained this to the manager and she was going to adjust our bill and give us desserts on Applebees. As if that wasnt a bad enough experience, this is actually when my story goes from BAD to HELL. While waiting for our desserts, my sister suddenly started having a seizure. We all scrambled to get out of the booth to help her. My mom and screamed for someone to call 911. Customers immediately started gathering around our area to watch our family drama. After several LONG minutes, 2 Applebees employees slowly approached our table and said that they had called 911. They acted like nothing serious was happening and then joined the customers watching my sister twitching on the floor. When the paramedics finally arrived my family was in a chaotic crisis mode. My sister was just becoming conscious and was confused and upset. My mother was taking it very hard and was sobbing. It was at this time that the Applebees manager decided that she needed to get my mothers phone number and other information and have her sign a waiver saying that Applebees wasnt liable for what happened to my sister! She was basically harassing her for her information and my mother was having a hard time remembering things as she was so upset. I am APPALLED at how Applebees handled this entire situation! Applebees is supposed to be a family restaurant. What a joke! I expected someone to come over and announce to the customers standing there staring at my sister to go back to their seats. I also expected a Applebees employee to treat us compassionately and realize the seriousness of the situation and not harass us to sign waivers. We will never go back there again and will tell everyone we know not to go there either.",,status,,2012-12-26 19:01:55,24,24,0

Josh, the manager, scheduled me for an interview, for a position with the restaurant. I spoke with him initially on 12.20.12 and the interview was arranged for 4:30PM 12.21.12. When I arrived I was told that Josh was not there and that another manager would interview me. I waited for a complete hour before anyone even acknowledged me. At 5:45PM Josh come to the table and handed me an application and stated he was ""unable to find"" the previous one I had filled out. I waited another 15 mins for Josh to return to the table for the interview. When I asked him if they were even any positions available, he stated that they were ""only accepting applications at the time, all the current positions were filled"", after which I got up and leave. I have been looking for a job long enough to know that anyone who says they are ""only accepting applications"" is NOT HIRING. I am an Army veteran, strong leader, smart and diligent worker, my valuable time was wasted. It reflects poorly on the location and the staff of Applebee's. Work is hard to come by and gas is too expensive. My time and energy to have been wasted. Any of the 3 managers in the building could have suggested I come in another time. I will not accept this kind of disrespect, I want to know actions will be taken to ensure this doesn't happen again to me or anyone else.

Now, several weeks later, I come to find a long string of complaints about the Applebee's organization reminiscent of what I'd see on Walmart's page.  

I just want to let you know that I love the Applebee's here in Cedar City, UT.  The manager always comes out to see how everyone is doing, the food is GREAT, and the service is wonderful.  One of my friends works in the kitchen there, and he's told me that it's one of the cleanest places he's ever seen.  All in all, everything is amazing.  

So don't give up hope Applebee's.  For every bad potato, I'm sure there are at least several restaurants who offer amazing service.

I have been a huge fan for a long time, well sadly that has all changed.... That is thanks to the newest addition to Applebee's located in Canton TX. This Applebee's has opened my eyes to some huge flaws your company has when it comes to employees! I personally know that this specific location does not treat it's employees the way they should! They have them work for 10hours straight with ABSOLUTELY NO breaks! This is illegal and needs to be reported!! YOUR EMPLOYEES SHOULD NOT BE TREATED LIKE SLAVES!! I have a few other complaints but wont list every single one of them! I have been to this location and had to wait an hour for our food and then when we get it 50% of all the things we order are incorrect, and still I was willing to stand by Applebee's but NO MORE!!! I know that our family and friends have spent outrageous amounts of money at Applebee's but we will not being doing that anymore if you can not treat your employee's who are a big part of the Applebee's experience better! They don't make enough in my opinion, they need to at least be treated properly! And treating them like prisoners will not do, and until this is addressed, my family will not be going to Applebee's nor will we recommend it to our friends!! Thanks for your time!

However yesterday we went in and was served raw boneless chicken wings and a burger that was bright pink in the middle that was ordered well done. The manager took off the wings from the bill and apologized. Ok fine, restaurants have bad moments. I get that.

The problem is my husband now has food poisoning and when I call to tell them I get blown off saying they have to do an investigation. I'm not asking for a million dollars here. All I'm asking for is to not have to pay for a meal where half of it was inedible and the other half poisoned my husband. Is that really too much to ask for after being loyal to you after all these years?

Our waitress took 10 minutes to give me the check, after asking. 4. The waitress never asked how our meal was/ if we needed a refill (we did). 5. The waitress gave us the incorrect change.  Our bill was $21 and change. I paid with a $100 bill and should have gotten back $78 and change. I got back $80 in mixed bills though, just because she knew I didn't have any smaller bills on me. She wanted me to leave a $5 tip instead of 10% ($1.20) she would have gotten. (Normally I tip 20% but her service was some of the absolute worst I have ever had at any restaurant) 6.

I am writing to inform you about a recent experience I had with the Manager, James, at the Applebees location at 3702 Easton-Nazareth Highway, Easton, Pennsylvania. I ordered a SIZZLING apple pie for dessert. I have ordered this dessert numerous times. The pie is supposed to be warm. I got my pie and it was cold not even warm in the slightest bit. I sent the pie back. While waiting for a new one, the manager, James, came to my table. The first words out of his mouth were What is going on? I was taken aback by his tone and his wording but I proceeded to try and tell him what my complaint was. I managed to get about five words out before he interpreted me and started on a rant about how he was going to take the skillet and make it hot hot hot. He was rude and extremely disrespectful.  I told him that I no longer wanted it at all. He said well he is already making it and I repeated my request that I did not want it. He stomped off saying well we will just throw it away then.  This to me is unacceptable behavior for anyone in service let alone the Manager. I work in retail and if a customer comes to me with a Complaint the first words out of my mouth are always Im sorry and how can I fix it for you.

Well last week my daughter wanted to take me to lunch/dinner it was 4 pm in the afternoon she had to be at work at 5 we ordered the 2 for 20 I got the new chipotle steak and waited 42 minutes for it. The manger came over I knew he was the manger by his tag never introduced himself......and this is what he said to me......Well was it worth the wait.........are you kidding me I had to put it in a to go box so that my daughter would not be later for work. Never offered to take anything off the ticket for us a courtesy for the long wait. Then when the waitress......who I must say did a great job till she brought the ticket she always kept check on and apologized sincerely for the wait. Well when she brought the ticket she had the nerve to ask me would you like me to get my manger to take something off your ticket for your wait........first of all I came in there with the intention of paying for what I ordered.....but the most courteous thing for you to have done was went to your manger had him give a little discount for a 42 minute wait on a 4 oz steak then came over to the table gave the ticket and say as a courtesy to you for the long wait Ive had my manger discount your ticket. Needless to say the $10 tip that the waitresses get when I go in the south store she didnt get as much she got half.

84917689333_10151151065119334,I would just like to say how disgusted I am with Applebees!!!!  in Ga a woman had the police called on her because she would not breastfeed her child in the bathroom.  The manager tried to force her feed her son in the bathroom!  I'm outraged.  It is not illegal to bf. In public and Ga	its one of 42 states that has a law to protect breastfeeding mothers.  I breastfeed my son and I'm so proud of this woman and her conviction to stay strong while by belittled by the manager who I hope will be fired.  The police officer did not even file a complaint on the woman.  She broke no law.  I think all Applebees should be required to have the breastfeeding sticker on the door letting families know bfing is acceptable.  I for one will not eat a Applebees again until there is an apology and the sticker goes on ALL Applebees nationwide.  Also I would lik to know if you were made aware of this.  If not pls contact me and I will give you the location of the store.  It made local news btw!  So disgusted. Ugh.,,status,,2012-09-19 21:38:05,19,13,0

Also, if the  'seasonal vegetable' is going to be broccoli, just say 'broccoli'. Cause, let's be honest here, it's ALWAYS broccoli. And if your seafood section is just going to be six kinds of shrimp and one single solitary fish dish, why not just call it EVEN MORE SHRIMP. I'd be saying this on the survey thingy but my BF lost the receipt so I'm totally using word-graffiti. <.<""",,status,,2012-09-12 15:21:07,5,4,0

84917689333_10151139933709334,"I was really impressed with the staff at the Applebee's in Cedar Lake, Biloxi, MS (951 Cedar Lake Rd. Biloxi, MS 39532). My fellow firefighters and myself went out to Applebee's to grab a bite to eat. We were in our dress uniforms because it was 9/11 and we wanted to honor those that are no longer with us. I was really surprised when the staff, not just our server and the manager, but the entire staff stopped to thank us for our service. It made us all feel extremely welcomed. The server was extremely nice and genuinely cared for us. He was talkative and knew the menu well. He had conversations with us and made us feel like we were best friends with him. We did have a problem with my meal, I ordered the Cajun Shrimp Pasta and when it came out it had mushrooms in it. I am extremely allergic to mushrooms and when I found them I immediately told my server. He apologized and I felt like he meant it. He then took my plate and told me another one would be out shortly. I didn't have to wait long at all before he brought me out a new one. He handled that situation like a champ. I was really impressed and extremely satisfied. When we got the check we noticed that the Appetizer Sampler we ordered to split between all of us was taken off and we were given a 10% discount. Not only that, but because we had a party of 7 we were automatically given a gratuity charge. Our server marked that out and said we didn't have to pay that because ""[we've] already paid enough."" I had tears in my eyes when I left. Not because we had a bad time, but because that restaurant genuinely cared about us and what we do. That feeling is priceless. If all Applebee's are like this I will always find one where ever I travel. I'd like to thank the staff there and tell them what a wonderful night they made for us.

You guys use cheap Hillshire Farms smoked sausages, thinking people won't pay attention to details. So I had the waitress ask the cook what type of sausage was used and she came back and told me it was for sure andouille but, that wasn't good enough for me so I had to challenge her response from the chef so I asked to speak to the manager and then he went back and checked and came back to tell me that it wasn't andouille and apologized.

We went in and about 45 minutes later they finally came and said that the cooks burnt the steaks and should be out shortly.  Then my steak and my husbands steak fajitas came out and I had ordered mine medium well.  So I went to cut into it and it was medium rare.  I told the waiter and he looked at it and then decided to argue with me that it was medium well and wanted to know how much more cooked I wanted it.  Then took it back.  So finally after being there for about an hour I got to eat!  So frusterating especially with a 4 year old and after already waiting for our food for so long.  ,,status,,2012-02-03 23:00:14,5,2,0

Last night while I was on an Ambulance shift, my crew and I attempted to have dinner there, the city was not too cooperative though and shortly after being seated and orders taken we got dispatched to a seizure call.  That call rolled into a follow on accident with vehicle fire call, and then we were sent again to an unconscious victim across the city.  So after 4 hours of this we finally got a break.  I contacted the restaraunt and spoke with the manager on shift and with only 15 minutes left to closing, she had our entire orders remade and packaged ready to go.  She even offered to wait for us or she would deliver to the fire station in case we got called out again.  This kind of customer service and support of public safety folks is why I continue to be a huge fan of your franchise.  Thank you very much.

In some other states, this sign would carry no weight of law but here in Ohio, it does. So without that respect, then I and my family will be taking our business elsewhere. Went into a local steak house and there was a sign there, told the manager the same thing and right there on the spot he took the sign down. There will be soon 300,000 CHLs in Ohio.

My wife, son and I visited this location. The service was bad and the portion size of the food was shockingly small. The service was with two competing servers that never left us alone. If one server wasn't asking us questions, then the other server came by to ask the same question. We ordered apps to come first and then ordered our entrees after the server returned with drinks. The apps came and 2 minutes behind that were our meals. We had to tell them to take them back until we finished what was laughingly called our appetizers ($29.98 of nothingness). When the entrees came, they were no longer hot. At the end of the meal, we asked for a bag to carry my son's unfinished and overpriced chicken. The server said yes and then ignored us. After waiting 5 minutes for his return (and he passed us twice in that time), we left. ",,status,,2011-06-26 09:22:58,1,9,0

All I'm saying is, I have always enjoyed eating at Applebee's and I think you've got a great menu, and yes, maybe sometimes, a waiter made a mistake or service was about 5 minutes later than normal, but you're employees are human, and I think they are doing a great job of putting their best foot forward.

They pointed out to the bartender the drinks had been shorted and he told her they were to fill it to the apple on the glass. So they asked for a glass of water no ice (pint) and whe...n they were done with the beer they dumped the pint glass of water into the brewtus glass and bam same place! So paying for a brewtus and not getting anymore beer for the price! She brought it to the bartenders attention who went and told the manager and nothing was done. We were also not happy esp after learning of this deception!!! We go at least every week sometimes more and always order at least 4 beer's each time. I feel so ripped off.

We began to backtrack and look for the crayon when one of the waitresses noticed us looking for it and asked what was wrong. I told her and she said let me get her a new one. She stopped what she was doing and went and got my daughter a new Green crayon. She was very busy and was not even our waitress but she took the time to care about my child being upset and helped to fix the problem! Now that's customer service!

It's not easy to make an excellent service to everybody but I guarantee we really do the best for our customers! We the hostess try our best to buss our tables, the servers have to run food and talk to the customers, the expo (someone who prepare the food) has to yelled at the kitchen to keep up the time, etc. Sometimes we have a rough night where literally 50 people came at once.

Honestly, this is a different type of license that has MORE personal information than a driver's license AND you must get a QUARRY CHECK on you to have it....and yet she was denied one measly little drink.  What's next?  I should try my passport next time and then complain that it's a FEDERAL ID.  

We generally ENJOY Applebee's but with the party of people (8), which included my boyfriend, father, sister, and friends, even the whole ""crew"" of us found this offensive and unprofessional.  Once we chewed out whoever was in charge of the restaurant, we still ate there.  I even ordered a MARGARITA and my ID wasn't checked!

First, I am a Navy veteran who has been employed by Applebee's for almost 7 years. I take great pride in the fact that our company offers a free meal to veterans and active duty military on Veterans day. To my knowledge, no other chain is or has done this with the exception of Golden Corral. Is anyone currently typing out their rage at this injustice on any of their Facebook pages? Are you calling these other chains and demanding full page appologies? I havent seen any???

84917689333_10150362996649334,"APPLEBEE'S HERE IS THE SOLUTION TO SO OBVIOUSLY NOT AN ISOLATED CASE......

That
 is correct Applebee's you did not state that what happened was right...
 nor did you state that it was wrong and it will be handled 
appropriately.  

As a Marine Corps Veteran and the aunt of the young men, I would first like to state that
 the best PR move right now would be action.  I fully understand as we 
all do how easy it is to appease with kind words.  However, if 
Applebee's stands by its dedication to Veterans and Veterans service 
organizations, then I suggest the following...

Applebee's needs 
to reprimand, and demote these two individuals at the Miller Road Flint,
 MI Applebee's.  To terminate them would not teach them what they 
obviously do not understand.  

Furthermore, these two individuals need to
 first and foremost PUBLICALLY APOLOGIZE to these boys as well as all of
 my brothers and sisters who have given all and still give all today to 
guard our great land and allow them the freedoms they so disturbingly 
take for granted.  

Second, these two individuals need to spend at the 
bare minimum six months providing community service hours within a 
Veteran's Service Organization.  

I have many in mind as you 
already know we come from a long line of highly honored Marines, 
Soldiers, Sailors, and Airmen.  

Just as all of our men and women show 
their integrity each day by keeping their promise to protect you, your 
children, and your land... I request that if Applebee's indeed has 
integrity that they will stand by their statement of dedication to 
Veterans and Veterans Service Organizations.

This is an easy 
enough request to respond to with action.  If Applebee's chooses not to 
entertain the request nor act on it, then it will be blatantly obvious 
that Applebee's has no integrity and willnot be supported and protected 
by the so many that it failed.  

Action speaks louder then words... we are now waiting... we are watching... just as we always are...

I only pray for you that the right decisions are made because it is only the first shot that counts.....",US Military Tribute - Far Away - Nickleback,video,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyXYot6wHuE&feature=share,2010-11-13 21:49:55,0,2,0

There was a fight between two guys near the bar and the manager let the screaming and cussing go on way too long. (I had my 4 yr old son with me) The kids in Applebee's were crying one person was screaming that one of the men had a gun. I totally understand that the manager has no control over who comes into his restaurant and how they act, BUT he does have control over how he handles the situation! 3.) After the police arrived and they got one of the men outside my son told me he had to use the restroom. I took him into the ladies room. When we went into the stall we saw splatters of brown stuff EVERYWHERE! It was sooo gross I wouldn't let my son use the bathroom.
