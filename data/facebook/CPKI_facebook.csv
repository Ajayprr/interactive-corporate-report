Between the server who was more interested in watching basketball on tv, frozen tomato sauce and dry pasta dinners, it was disappointing.  I made a complaint online, and was contacted by Lisa, the General manager there. She said she would take both dinners off our cards, and send a gift card. Instead, the cards got charged. It took almost 3 weeks to get the promised refunds. I also spoke to Marcus 2x at this location who also said he'd send a gift card for the trouble. A month later, still waiting for it.

I ordered the pepperoni instead and my husband ordered the bbq chicken. There was little, if any sauce on either of our pizzas. The only taste on my pizza came from the pepperoni. My husband's tasted like bland chicken with onions thrown on. I used to love coming here, but I don't think I will be returning.

79746038702_10155992470123703,"So a few days ago my family n friends n I decided to eat dinner at CPK Kapolei. We have been there twice for lunch and both experiences were great. This time we went for dinner. We were told the wait was about an hr. Which is usually fine,  90mins (1 1/2hr) goes by and my friend asked the front  how long more of a wait,  the lady in front told him there was 7 more parties ahead of you.  He comes back tells us that,  and at this point kids are starving. Mind you the entire back is empty, there were a few tables open when I looked in. We wait for another 20mins and still no call.  I approached the front and asked if she could give me an update,  she looked at me and couldnt give an answer. I then asked if I could place a order for the kids so that it could be ready when we sat since kids were starving. She said ""no"", I then asked for a manager explained to her what was going on and how long we waited (1hr 50mins ) and then she seats us a few minutes later.  Next we order water,  1 beer,  and our food since we all knew what we wanted. The waitress was not the issue here at this point.  We ask for bread and she said it was still being baked. 30mins go by, NO beer, NO bread. 45mins go by.. and a plate of bread comes,  1 piece for each person.  We ask for more since we still had not received our food,  she states again.. its being baked.  Food comes out almost 50mins after being sat. Burnt n overcooked food! At this point kids were beyond starvning and ate the crispy burnt pizza,  i recieved Salmon took one bite and was so disappointed on how dry it wasit was overcooked ..i couldnt eat it. My husband steak wasn't medium cooked, but he was starving and just ate it. My friends eggrolls n pizza was also burnt. We didn't end up eatting the 1 pizza, egg rolls nor salmon. Finally the beer comes in and get this!!! It comes 1/2 glass full,  waitress states the keg needs to be changed out. Mind you 50mins later after being sat it took 1/2 glass drink to come out along with Overcooked burnt food.  Worst ever and to make matters worst we returned the food and they only took it off the bill. Still ended up paying for an over cooked steak, burnt pizza and a 1/2 of beer...all for 3hrs. Guess we will be staying at the CPK at Pearlridge.",,status,,2018-01-07 13:40:31,0,0,0

Since the menu changed this past spring, we had stopped going to the restaurant.  Last night we had an out of town visitor who wanted to go so we did.  Unlike the last time, it was impossible for the kitchen staff to provide pasta with any vegetables.  We could however purchase one of the meat based entrees without the meat (but we'd still pay for it).  Talk about a money grab!  

Our out of town guest wanted a small side salad but only expensive half salads were available - she wanted without the bacon and other high calorie items and asked to substitute plain veggies which was also denied.

The wait staff was cordial. and really tried to be helpful going back to the kitchen a few times to see what they could do.  He seemed genuinely sad when the answer was basically ""nothing"".

After having to go to the bar myself, the bar tender put tonic on my drink instead of soda. I asked for the manager. I politely explained what had been going on. He said he would fix it. After waiting another 15 mins with no drink I went back to the bar and the manager, Rick, told me they didn't have tonic in the gun and it couldn't be. I said something is wrong with it so why don't you make me a new one. He told me I had too much to drink and stormed off. TOO MUCH - I hadn't even had 1/2 a drink yet.

We waited 20 minutes for ice cream. We were paid out and everything and still no ice cream. I asked the waitress she said it hasn't been started. I said forget it and asked for a manager.

You have a location at Andares in Guadalajara, Mexico, a shopping mall that is openly racist and discriminates against indigenous and LGBTQ people. There have been many incidents now where people have been denied access or removed from the premises, and the owners and administrators have recently forced Levi's to remove their Pride advertisements and threatened to not renew their contract if they didn't. Martha Leao, one of the owners and administrators, have justified their actions by saying: ""We believe in God's design for man and woman, will continue to defend family values and will never agree with other genders"". Does CPK endorse this discriminatory attitudes? As a loyal customer, I hope you don't. Thanks, Fernando from Guadalajara, MX.",,status,,2016-07-12 19:30:41,2,1,0

It took another 15 minutes for them to box the food and bring us our checks. 

We paid and asked to speak to a manager. Who told us that the catering orders took priority over the customers in the restaurant! We were told excuse after excuse. To the point where it was almost as if WE the customers were the problem for wanting to eat at their restaurant. Had we been told there was a long wait we would have gone elsewhere. 

We paid full price and left. Upon opening our bags we then discovered all our orders were not only wrong but stone cold. Basically the only part of the order that was right was the 3 waters we ordered to drink.

Store ID: 0202
Overall Satisfaction: Highly Satisfied

Why Highly Satisfied: This was me and my friends first time. We entered and where immediately greeted by Jesse. It was really busy but he asked how many and we said two then i saw a spot at the bar and asked for to sit there. Jesse introduced to our server Dru. Dru went over the menu . We both ordered the lemonade jim bean honey drink which was really good! We then ordered a Cesar salad to split between the two of us which was one of the best Cesar i have ever had. we then ordered two pizzas one bbq chicken pizza and one five cheese pizza with pepperoni on half. After seeing the five cheese pizza me and my friend realized that tomatoes came on the pizza. The head chef paul said no problem and made us a new pizza without tomatoes. Then Jesse who turned out to be the district manager brought us out one of the best deserts i ever had. It was some sort of sugar cake with ice cream on it. I then thanked jesse and told him about how my father had just passed away this week. It was the first time i had really ate out since his passing. And i wanted him to know how much the service meant to me. Head chef Paul then came over and told me that they where taking care of the whole bill. I was absolutely blown away as was my friend. being a younger man usually I get average service. Here i was treated like a VIP from the beginning. This is the type of service i would love to work for or model as a place to work at. I can not express in words how amazing this experience was!

There are high bar tables that expand the bar area, but this evening two couples with six children with little Morocca's were seated there. We came in like we always do for dinner, but the people to our right finally asked them to stop making so much noise behind us, and the families  complained to the manager who was just not very presetn in the restaurant tonight. My husband is hard of hearing so didn't understand what was happening-he could not hear it.  Suddenly, after the manager walks around to the bar, and we all said ""Thank You"" two middle eastern men from this family started threatening my husband from behind his back.  He had no idea what was happening, but had a very injured neck and could not turn around.  After the screaming escalated and the manager just watched it all and took no action, I left a $100 bill on the table and walked out to protect him from injury. This manager was absolutely worthless and should have a class in managing these situations. This place should never serve parents alcohol in the bar area and patrons should not be vulnerable to such things from behind.

We will never patronize this place again.",,status,,2016-03-25 23:07:04,0,0,0

This year during my reign as 2015 Jr. Miss Beauties Of The Nations I have set a goal to raise $15,000.00. 

On Monday, August 17th, I will be hosting a FUNdraiser at the California Pizza Kitchen in Huntington Beach at Bella Terra. Please print this flyer and present it to your server. 20% of your bill will be donated to the Orange Coast Memorial Foundation benefiting breast cancer.

79746038702_10153403731523703,"I am writing regarding a frustrating experience this afternoon at one of your restaurants. I dined for lunch at the CPK on City Ave in Philadelphia with a few friends and my 2.5 year old daughter.  I ordered a kids pizza for my daughter and told the waiter she has an egg allergy so I wanted to make sure there was no egg in the pizza.  He checked and came back to me saying there is an egg wash in all of the pizza dough.  I then tried to order her a kids pasta or Mac n cheese...again I was told there is egg in all of the pasta. Unfortunately the only item on the menu that was safe for her to eat was grilled chicken and a fruit cup.  I found it extremely frustrating that she eats pasta and pizza all the time, yet at your restaurant there were no egg free options.  I even asked if a grilled cheese could be made for her and I was told that they didn't have grilled cheese.  Unfortunately my daughter could only have the fruit cup for lunch. When I got home, I looked on the allergen guide on the website which shows that there is no egg in the children's pizzas.  When I called the manager to discuss my frustration, he told me he did not believe the information on the website was up to date because there is a new dough being used currently which does in fact have egg in it.  I would hope that due to the high level of food allergies today, you can include more allergy friendly foods including pizza and pasta.  Also, this information should be updated on your website to include the most current allergen information.  My previous dining experiences at this location and all other CPK's have been positive, but I am hoping some changes can be made so that not only my daughter and I can return but other children with egg allergies as well.  Thank you.",,status,,2015-06-24 13:29:56,0,1,0

She has been working odd and end jobs to earn some money but still needs a little more to go with it. If you can help in any way, even if it is only a $5 donation, anything helps. She has been looking forward to this trip for months. 

Any help at all would be much appreciated.

79746038702_10153355904553703,"There's a first time for everything, and today was my first very negative experience with the CPK location in Westwood, Los Angels. For the past several weeks, I have been calling in by phone for a pick-up order on behalf of my wife every Thursday, and today I got the rudest and least professional response I've ever gotten at any CPK restaurant, or indeed, anywhere else. 

After two employees hung up on me, I was greeted by someone who, ironically, recognized me for being a repeat customer, and yet, at one point, interrupted me and literally said this: ""Sir, do you want to place an order ..."" Taking this as a rude, unacceptable threat, I replied that I had called in for that very reasonbut had faced a stonewall of unprofessionalism, indifference and rudeness. Then, to my considerable shock, the line went dead.

I finally managed to place the orderwith someone who asked if I'd like avocado on the side. I asked what the price was, and, to my astonishment, she replied that she wasn't sure but that she thought it was $2.70 (or $2.79). For the record, despite being a longtime CPK customer, I resent the way in which customers are routinely asked if they'd like an additional this or thatwithout being given the slightest inkling that the item is not free. 

In my final attempt to complain, I called CPK's corporate office (310-342-5000), where someone who admitted she was new to the job directed to someone who wasn't at his desk.",,status,,2015-06-04 16:01:52,0,1,0

The decor changes are okay, I just can't for the life of me figure out why anyone would think it's better to take out booths and replace them with free standing tables. Most people prefer to sit in a booth. 

You've also changed the menu and taken off some favorite items: the white pizza and the meat lovers pizza. I ordered the pepperoni mushroom sausage and it came with these giant chunks of dried oregano. I don't know why you'd think DRIED oregano was a good idea in the first place, but when it's not ground up, you get big hard pieces that are scratchy in your mouth and throat.

                    My Name is Logan Cohn I am 13 years old and I have to brag about the  best Mom in the world :
My mom is a single mom of two kids and two dogs ! My mom is my everything. My mom recently  had foot surgery  and that still does not slow her down. My mom does  whatever she can to help our family and protect us. I don't think there is a  day  I can remember when  my mom is  actually buying herself something instead of buying us stuff. Me and my sister Sophie (11)
 are  her everything and I'm am so  thankful for  that. My mom comes home from a long day of work and she still finds the energy-to go  out to dinner  rewarded us for good grades or great behavior . For example when my mom had foot surgery that night she still took us out for our traditional  Passover dinner despite just recently having foot surgery. I just  want to say my mom is the best mom and she would do anything and I mean anything for Me or my sister or a friend . I love my mom for that. Not to mention that she puts her own personal life on hold  to rush home to see us .My mom  comes home with a smile asking us how were doing and how was our day .  My mom is literally like the wonder Women  to me. She's there every day to pick us me up . Without my mom I don't even know if I would even have a roof over my head ,food ,or water . I would not have that without my mom. I would  be a nobody without her . Some weeks my mother works over 80 hours a week  and still  comes  home with a smile and a story .My mom is always there for us always with enough love to go around  . My mom lives life to it fullest. AlI these reasons is what makes my mom so special . I  have the best mom  in the world and  I love her so much.I hope that I am can have all her great qualities rub off on my sister and I .",,photo,https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=673924619402778&set=o.79746038702&type=3,2015-05-01 19:18:17,5,0,0
79746038702_1555555574707957,"#CPKDearMomSweeps... What do you think of when you think of beauty? What about perfection? Do you think of the sky, maybe? The clouds twist together like lovers, dancing around each other and spinning apart. They glow in the soft light of dawn, the time when the sun is just waking up. The sky lights up pink, softening into an orange before fading through the purple to its clear blue. At dusk when the loud, bright world winds down, the clouds deepen into purple. They remind you of easier days, before everything broke apart, shattering into a noisy city scape. Before obnoxious cars, driven by doubly obnoxious people. Before, when children were a blessing rather than a curse. They remind you that there is still beauty and perfection in this world of illusions.

When I think of beauty and perfection, I also think of strength and love. I think of you. I never thought thered be this woman who could love, more than her own life, her children. My first experience with Mothers was not a good one. Honestly, I feel like I will never be able to think that I am accepted by anyone. There is, however, one exception. There is one, single, solitary person in the world who I feel like loves me. She is the most amazing person I never thought to want. Id need nothing more than her and I know that. Shes become my best friend, and you must understand, I never expected this type of relationship to come between us. I used to despise any type of affection from her. I hated thinking that she knew me. I hid everything from her, knowing that nothing would hurt me worse than hurting her. Lets be honest, now, I know it hurt her to think I didnt love her. But that was never the case. 

Even before I knew I could trust her with everything, I loved her. I felt accepted by her. I feel like that may be the reason I never told her anything in the beginning. I didnt want her to run away from me. I didnt want her to turn her back on me, finally realizing that I was scum of the earth, as I knew I was. Even though I will never be more than this broken pile of nothing, she loves me. Who would have guessed that I would find this acceptance in the person who I was most scared of letting in? Shes the one person I cant run from, because I cant leave my mom. What would I do if she didnt accept me? Honestly, Id find a way out. Id have to. I wouldnt be able to take that kind of rejection from two women who were supposed to love me more than anything. 

I've learned not to be afraid of that anymore. I know she loves me and accepts me. Not because she has to, but because shes found in her heart that she can.

So when I think of beauty and when I think of perfection, the woman who's given me everything is who comes to mind.

I love you, Mom.",,photo,https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=1555555574707957&set=o.79746038702&type=3,2015-05-01 14:14:18,0,0,0

79746038702_10152805111370460,"We tried the new Korean Barbecue Pizza at the Short Hills Mall Location, and we weren't impressed. The pizza came out with all the vegetable toppings piled onto one half of the pizza. If it's not supposed to be evenly distributed, then they should at least be piled in the center. 

The flavor of this ""sweet and spicy"" barbecue sauce was nearly non-existent, and the pork was a tad dry. The entire pie was overshadowed by the Ponzu vinaigrette. The so-called ""julienne"" pears were more ""diced"", and the carrots were more shredded. This isn't a huge deal, but perhaps you should refrain from specifying a fruit/vegetable cut if you aren't going to use it. 

Perhaps the most disappointing thing was the crust. I was unable to tell if the crust was just a little undercooked in the center or softer than usual, or if it was a reaction to the vinaigrette that was on the serving plate, but the crust was very soft- almost soggy. It could not support the weight of the toppings, and that made eating it a challenge. 

This is definitely not a pizza we'll order again anytime soon. However, the toppings DO have the makings to become a wonderful addition to the salad menu.",,photo,https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10152805111370460&set=o.79746038702&type=3,2014-10-22 08:25:16,0,1,0

It was most of our first times there and we had the sweetest nicest waiter Jordan. He asked why we were there and we explained me and my sister were meeting for the first time this weekend. My sister points out that there should be a song for adopted kids meeting for the first time just like the birthday song you sing. Well Jordan delivered. He wrote a beautiful song and gave us a time to remember. He is definitely an employee that will do what they need for the customer. Thanks Jordan!!! Hope your move from NM is a great one and we will be back to CPK next time in Orlando.,,video,https://www.facebook.com/imanib1/videos/10202458497085647/,2014-07-07 10:53:59,2,4,0

79746038702_10201467163152510,"Dear CPK

I would like to comment on my recent dining experience that I received at 6pm today.

The server was very friendly, and greeted us as soon as we sat down. We ordered our drinks, and she was very prompt in bringing them to us as well. I ordered some lemons for my water, and she brought a big bowl of them for me as well, which I very much appreciated. 

My girlfriend and I ordered our pizza and a salad, which we both shared. Again, the server was very prompt and we did not notice a delay on our food. I drank my water relatively fast, and she never did come around to refill my glass. Only until after I was almost finished will all of my food, was I able to get some more water. 
The food was good, I really liked that the crust was very soft and fresh. Unfortunately, this is the end of my positive experience with my visit today. 

The reason I am writing in, is because of the issue we had paying for our meal. I was given a gift card for my birthday back in January, that I first used at the end of that month. When I use gift cards, I write the remaining balance in Sharpie on the card, so that I know how much money I have left on my card. The reason I chose to visit California Pizza Kitchen today, was because I still had $6.00 on my gift card, or so I thought. When the server came with the check, I gave her my gift card as well as my debit card to pay the remaining balance of the check. When she came back, I noticed that there was only a $.13 balance charged on my gift card, and then a remaining balance of $0.00 afterward. I was very shocked by this, because I had written $6.00 on my gift card, so I knew I had that much left on my card after my first visit in January. I spoke with the manager on duty, Stella , and informed her that there was $6.00 on my gift card before my visit today. She went ahead and started telling me that maybe someone else has used the card without me knowing. This was not possible, since I have had the card in my possession since I received it back in January for my birthday. She gave me this explanation 2 times. Both times I let her know this was not possible. My question for her, was how can I see the transaction history for my gift card, to confirm the expected balance I should have on my gift card. She pointed out the website address (www.cpk.com) on the gift card, as well as the phone number (888.351.2594) to research the balance of my gift card. I went to the website, and I called the automated phone number. Both options gave me a balance of $0.00, without a history of transactions. I let her know the outcome of my research, and she did not give me any other options. This was very unfortunate. I was willing to secede my claim of there being $6.00 on my gift card, if I could find proof that backed up her claim that there was only $.13 on my card. 

Needless to say, my experience today was not pleasant. I was completely fair in my claim that I had a balance of $6.00 on my gift card, and that if I saw a statement of transactions that stated otherwise, then I would accept the fact that I incorrectly wrote the remaining balance on my card. I was not given any proof of the opposing claim, which leaves me unhappy with my visit today. This is not the way I like to spend my money, and not the way a company should run their business. 

I did not yell. I did not cause a scene. So I did not disrupt business for any of the other customers. I was just direct with the manager, and let her know my stance on the issue. After trying to problem solve the issue for 20 minutes, I asked the manager for her business card and left the restaurant. Thank you for this negative experience, and I will not be visiting your establishment in the future.

For reference here is the number on my gift card:

A very strange day.....stumbled upon some shocking info last night online, which in turn gave me nightmares, and then this morning discovered that a friend had died unexpectedly.....today has been an emotional day of processing everything....setting me back a day of normal activity. Praying for healing and to move forward. R.I.P. Jeffrey Conners - BIG heart, tortured soul ~ and blessings to all.

My family ate at one of your restaurants earlier today (the food and service were very good) however when I saw the ""gratuity guide"" on the receipt, I got very upset.

As you can see on the photo I attached, the receipt says that an 18% gratuity on $48.83 (the amount before tax) is $11.97.

Do the math:  It's actually $8.79

My first thought was ""maybe they calculated it using the total amount?""  Well, based off the total receipt amount of $52.86, the correct 18% tip would be $9.51

Can you explain this discrepancy?  I feel that CPK was dishonest.  I did the math and this amount is roughly a 24.5% tip...",,photo,https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10152189343721675&set=o.79746038702&type=3,2014-01-27 00:47:10,0,3,0

DISTRICT 219 EDUCATION FOUNDATION HOSTS FOURTH ANNUAL PIZZA WARS: WHO WILL BE TOSSED THE TITLE OF PIZZA MAESTRO 2014?

January 16, 2014, 6-9pm at Niles West High School

SKOKIE, IL (JANUARY 16, 2014)  The District 219 Education Foundation for Excellence, with the assistance of the student organization Dance Marathon, will host its 4th annual Pizza Wars on Thursday, January 16th, 2014, as pizza ovens across Niles township will be fired up in preparation for the Foundations signature fundraiser, Pizza Wars 4: May The Fourth Be With You. After last years standing room only success, the event has been moved to the larger contest gym at Niles West High School (5701 Oakton, Skokie). The question plaguing allwill Village Inn retain its title of Maestro or will the trophy be tossed to another?

Pizza tasting will begin at 6pm, ending at 7:15pm. The trophy will be awarded at 7:30pm. Advanced ticket prices are $12 per person, $40 for a family of 4, and $15 per person at the door. The evening will also feature live entertainment from Niles West and North student bands, face painting and a strolling magician for the young at heart. Tickets may be purchased on the Foundations website at www.219foundation.org.

Last year, over 850 people tasted delectable bites of pizzas from over 13 of the townships amazing pizzerias. The Education Foundation met their goal, raising over $8,500! For Pizza Wars 4, the Education Foundation has set the bar slightly higher with an aggressive goal of $10,000. All funds raised will be used to benefit the students of District 219.

Approximately three out of every ten District 219 students qualify for the free or reduced-price lunch program, a number that has grown dramatically since the Foundation was formed. Since 2007, the Foundation has awarded more than $135,000 in grants in the form of graphing calculators, refurbished computers, AP testing, college entrance exams, community college scholarships, and college campus bus tours for students who may not have considered higher education until their visit. More recently, the Foundation has also been providing school supplies and breakfast bars to students in need.

Please help the Foundations cause by becoming an Extra Cheese and Sausage Sponsor with a $250 donation, or a Cheese Only Sponsor with a $150 donation. The awards of becoming a sponsor are priceless. Please visit the District 219 website at www.219foundation.org for more information, or to purchase tickets for Pizza Wars 4.

79746038702_10151795459828910,"We live in Studio City and frequent the CPK at 12265 Ventura Blvd. We eat there so often that all the staff know us by first names. There's been an ongoing problem with the escalator from the ground level up to the restaurant. For the better part of two years, 80% of the time we went there the escalator was out of order. We are not spring chickens, so the steep stairs were awkward. And the elevator is so far towards the back of the premises that walking back t here and again forward to the restaurant defeated the purpose. We complained - mainly to no avail - but for the last few months the escalator has been working. But now there's a worse problem. When you get on the first step of the escalator, and put your hands on the rubber railings, you come away with black grime on your hands. Attached picture shows my left hand against the white tile wall back near the bathrooms. When I've complained to the managers, they shrug it off and say it's the landlord's fault. Do you think I really care whose fault it is? I care that it happens every time, and over my lifetime and thousands of rides on escalators all over the world, I've never had it happen anywhere else. It is instinctive to reach for the railing so I'll be offended if you tell me I just shouldn't touch it. We dine at that CPK two to three nights a week, and our average check is about $50.00, so we spend about $6000-$7000 per year in that store. It's about to go elsewhere!",,photo,https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10151795459828910&set=o.79746038702&type=3,2013-08-15 22:09:19,1,3,0

79746038702_10101936928636331,"To whom it may concern: Today, my mom and I decided to have lunch at one of our favorite spots, California Pizza Kitchen at International Mall, in Tampa Florida. When we first arrived, there was confusion among servers as to where we could sit, because my 2 year old needed a high chair. We were finally sat down, just as another group was about to sit at the same table, and unfortunate for that group... They were told they had to stand outside and wait longer. So we sit down, and our servers cell phone starts ringing. No big deal, not something that typically bothers me. Except that she went on and on telling us how ""you didn't hear that!"". We order drinks, and she gets the drink order wrong. No big deal, we improvise. We ask for more napkins, 3 times, before receiving them. My mom asked a question about a salad, and our server yells over to the table next to us to say ""ma'am! Do you like your salad?! What do you think about it!?""... After the customer answered, the server says ""she likes it"" in response to my moms question ....  We order our food. I always order the BBQ chicken pizza, without cilantro. It is always delicious. What I got today, was a limp, greasy, excuse for a pizza that lacked toppings and flavor. It was pretty awful. When i picked up a piece, it literally fell limp, dripping with grease. We both commented that we could have gotten better pizza at cheapy Pizza Hut. Our drinks were never refilled. I went to the restroom and saw our server standing at the mirror, reapplying lipstick and fixing her hair. She walked out without washing her hands. When my mother asked for a to-go box, our server proceeded to take my plate from in front of me, WHILE I was eating! I did not ask for the box, and I was clearly still eating, pizza slice in hand. We Love your restaurant, and usually stop to eat there during every shopping trip at International Mall. Maybe today was an off day, but I think we will be taking a break from visiting your establishment with hopes that we will have a better experience in the future. Below is a picture of the advertised pizza I ordered, and the pizza I received. There was no chance of sending it back, with a hungry toddler and a server that never came back to ask how our food was or to refill our drinks. The 4 out of 6 slices that were packaged to go, will be tossed. Thank you for your time.",,photo,https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10101936928636331&set=o.79746038702&type=3,2013-07-07 14:27:19,4,3,0

To Whom It May Concern:
	I often go to eat at CPK to have lunch or dinner because I know that when I go, I can depend on getting a great meal, with a glass of wine in a clean, friendly and fresh, up to date atmosphere. On one particular occasion, my son and I went to the CPK in Ft Lauderdale, FL to get that dependable experience before we had to attend a school event that evening after a long day. On entering the restaurant, I was asked to fill out a raffle card for a chance to win an outdoor pizza oven.  
	I received an email around June 3rd, 2013 notifying me that I was the WINNER of the OUTDOOR PIZZA OVEN!!!!!!!! My first thought was one of excitement and the second thought was, how I was going to make arrangements to pick the oven up to bring it home.  I called the restaurant manager, Garret Saperstein, who gave me all the amazing details about how the oven was going to be delivered, set up, AND that the stores chef manager was going to come and show us how to make the pizzas and use the oven. Garret Saperstein stayed in contact with me and was so helpful and professional in making sure that every detail involving the oven was taken care of. 
	Arrangements were made for June 20, for Anthony Cruz, the Ft. Lauderdale chef manager, to deliver the oven and show us how to use it.  Anthony Cruz, was incredible. He was so polite, courteous, and is a marvelous chef. He shared with use the history of CPK, tips on pizza recipes, and above all, made they most amazing pizza from my new oven for my family, friends and me.  The entire experience was above and beyond my expectations.  
	I wanted to write and thank you for this marvelous experience you gave to my family, my friends,  and me.  I have always loved eating CPK, but now you have become my number one restaurant. Not only for the experiences that I have had eating in your restaurants, but because of the amazing staff you have hired.  Thank you again.  We will be enjoying the use of our new pizza oven for many years and parties to come.

79746038702_10151361638338703,"Sorry if this is a repeat post. I wasn't sure if my last post went through or not.

I am not one for complaining but my parents and I went to your location in the Natick mall. The food is always great and the waiters/waitresses are always friendly. So you are probably wondering what I am complaining about. The answer its the host and hostess. Tonight being a Friday night I expected the Resturant to be fairly busy and well it was. 15 minute wait not bad. All of the sudden around 10 minutes later they sat maybe 5-6 other party's of three that came in after us. That confused me and felt like it was very unfair. When I got up to ask how much longer, I was told very abruptly in a mean tone ""we're moving up the list"" okay so when it came time and the host called our name you could barely here him, he covered his mouth in a cone shape making it even harder to understand him. Now mind you we were only 10 feet from the host stand. We got up and the host looks and points to a booth and says your going to that booth once it gets cleaned. We stood there and asked multiple times if we should just head over and got no response so we made our way there ourselves. We are now sitting at our table and everything else is good. I must say this isn't the first time rarer the third time this has happened and I appericate that someone got back to me on here and sent us a gift card to use which we did. I am not asking for anything but just wanted to send my feedback to you

79746038702_10151343873018703,"Went to CPK tonight, of the hundred+ times I've been there, maybe a handful of times I've been disappointed. But the kind of disappointed where in a week, you don't remember why you were disappointed and you go back anyway. Not tonight. Tonight was awful. I spent $75 and can only justify spending $10. I ordered mac-n-cheese for my 11 month old who eats anything and everything. He wouldn't touch it. After tasting it myself, I understood why. There was barely any sauce, the noodles were stale somehow, and it was cold! My mom got the spaghetti bolognese, as usual, she never gets anything else. It was void of sauce, except for the very little dabble in the middle. Easy fix! Right? Wrong! She asked for more sauce. It arrived 10 minutes later, and although she tried to take her time knowing the sauce was on the way, only half of her dinner was left. She poured it on, happy to have her dinner completed. Upon taking a bite, the sauce was cold. Theme of the night! My roommate ordered the half size chinese chicken salad-she loved it and had no complaints. My other roommate ordered garlic cream fettuccine. The sauce was at least luke warm this time. However, she ordered and paid for chicken and mushrooms to be included. We counted the chicken pieces, there were three. We counted the mushrooms, there were four. If this is how the item came, no problem. But paying $4 for almost nonexistent luke warn chicken and mushrooms? RIP OFF. Finally, I ordered the full caesar salad. My salad was smaller than my roommates half chinese chicken salad. I absolutely thought, for sure, without a doubt, our waiter thought I ordered the half caesar salad. Imagine my surprise when I looked at the bill and I was charged for a full. To top off our disappointing night, in our very busy and packed section of the restaurant, a woman came through with a vacuum for almost five minutes! Who does that, or allows that to happen, at a busy restaurant on a Friday night at 7pm?! I looked at the floor as she was doing it and was puzzled. I looked up at the rest of my table, and then we all looked around only to be met with every other guest dining in a state of consternation because there just wasn't anything to constitute the vacuuming. I sincerely hope that this is not the beginning of the end for CPK. I have had so many special events at CPK and always considered it a treat to dine there. After tonight, I know I'm guaranteed better food at Coco's or even Souplantation. Thanks for the waste of time and money. Please get it together CPK.",,status,,2013-01-05 04:05:44,2,3,0

79746038702_10151253984613703,"Hi tonight my dad and I went to the CPK at the Natick Mall in Natick MA. I had called before we left our house to check on the wait and put our name in for call ahead seating. Mind you it takes us a half hour to get to that location. The lady that answered the phone said the wait was 30 minutes to an hour. When we got to the restaurant (30 minutes later) the hostess checked us in and said it would be another 45 minutes to an hour. This is what turned unpleasant as the hostess was rather rude saying that we had only called 10 minutes ago and thats why it would take so long. I told her and showed her on my cell phone (which is where I made the originating call)  that I had called 20 minutes before what she had said but she basically said that I was l lying. So we left and came back around half an hour later after shopping around in the mall. I once again stopped by to check in to make sure they didn't call our name since they don't have a pager system or also wont take down your cell phone number (VERY UNORGANIZED) so the hostess told me that had another 45 minutes to an hour. This is what made no sense to me considering we already waited 30 minutes prior to our 30 minutes when I had made the original phone call. I then told the hostess we would be waiting outside (due to the waiting area being completely packed) and she said ""well we don't normally go outside to call for people but we will do our best"" After a while it got chilly outside and I again went to check and she said that it would be another 30-40 minutes. Since we were sitting outside and it was getting cold we decided to wait inside the mall and I told her where we would be again she said ""we don't normally go into the general mall area to get people"" May I add that we were sitting right outside the indoor entrance to the restaurant form the mall. The hostess needs to learn better people skills. I also thought call ahead seating means you are put on the list when you call not when you get to the restaurant I guess I was wrong. Once we were seated we had a very pleasant waiter, who was very friendly. I do feel bad as he was waiting on 6 or 7 tables and always running around. Everything else was fine except for the beginning. I also feel that you should have a pager system or at least be able to take peoples phone number down so they can walk away from the restaurant if there is a wait.  But again this hostess was rude... kept blaming us (to the point where we almost left but after every restaurant in the area had over an hour wait we had no choice).  I wanted to share my expirence so you guys at the corporate level know you need a better organized system for seating people 
thanks

I do get tired of eating pizza and when a pizza restaurant also has many other incredible items, it makes it worthwhile going often (which I definitely do, or at least carryout).

79746038702_10151185500113703,"My fiance and I had an awful experience at your restaurant in Pittsburgh, PA.  When were being led by the hostess to the patio seating, and when she asked a server if she was taking tables outside, she said IN FRONT OF US ""I guess so, but I don't want to.""  Then we were seated and it took 15 minutes for someone to come and take our order, and there were only a few customers in the entire restaurant, so it was not busy.  This was a different server than the one who made it clear she did not want to serve us.  When she approached the table I smiled and asked how she was, she rolled her eyes and said with a nasty sarcasm, ""Oh, Living the dream.""  She made it as clear as the previous server that she was not happy to be there.  I asked a few questions about the menu and the server had no idea, including something so simply as what veggies were being served as a side.  We waited over 25 minutes for our meals to come out and the server never came back once to let us know what was taking so long, to ask if we needed drink refills, or to bring my bread.  When she did bring the meals, I asked if I get bread with my meal and she said with a scowl, ""If you want it.""  I asked if it was included in my meal and she said yes, so I wondered why she did not bring it for us to have something while we waited for our meals.  She never returned one time after we got our meals, to check on anything or to refill our drinks.  In the meantime, we watched the other miserable server treat her customers just as coldly, and even heard them complaining about the service.  We will never return to your restaurant, especially because we had 2 previous negative experiences at CPK, but we decided to give it another try on this day because the food is very good.  Unfortunately, we were highly disappointed and felt totally unwelcome, so we will not be returning again.  If you do not make changes to your staff at this CPK, it will surely be closing in the near future.  I feel confident that we are not the only customers who were highly disappointed.

Upon opening the pizza for cooking preparation I noticed the onions were frozen and clustered together in 3 distinct zones of the pizza with no coverage in other areas whatsoever.  I decided to take my chances.  After cooking the pizza for the recommended 12 minutes, I removed the pizza from the oven and examined the onion situation.  They were still in clusters, not a big deal, however when attempting to distribute the onions I noticed they were very slimy and mealy to the touch.  This pizza was the worst quality frozen pizza I have ever purchased.  I threw the pizza away as I felt it not safe to eat.  I have purchased this brand in the past with no issues.

79746038702_10151161279173703,well I had my very 1st experience with cpk yesterday evening. I had a very large party 9 people 6 of whom were children and 3 adults of which none were male. Now my 9 year old son had to go to the restroom and I felt confident that it was a task that he could accomplish himself. However I was wrong. Apparently there was water all over the mens room floor and my son didn't see it and slipped and fell. Which resulted it a large bruise on his forehead and a busted lip. After he feel he notified a cpk employee that was also in the restroom but instead of helping my son who was not only hurt but embarrassed the employee shrugged his shoulders and walked away. The waiter was kind enough to bring over and ice pack. Now mind you I was not nor am  looking for a free tab but i seriously think the manager could of done a little more than offer just my son free ice cream( which he didn't accept because there were 5 other children at the table who were not getting ice cream) and give him a certificate that i have to come back to use(I don't intend to) and take just his whole $5.50 meal off my tab!!!!!! To top it all off they kinda treated me like I was out for a free meal because I had such a large party and that maybe I didn't have enough money to pay! So needless to say I don't think I will ever be a cpk customer again 1st impressions are important!!!!,,status,,2012-09-08 13:52:22,0,3,0

We ate our entire meal without napkins or silverware (asked for them 3 times) despite the fact our server kept apologizing for forgetting them. We never got refills on our drinks and probably saw our server 3 times at the most. We felt like we were bothering her everytime she dropped by. To make things worse, my order was incorrect, but there was no way we had the time to wait for a correction. The restaurant was admittedly busy, but the service was truly atrocious. The service was so slow we didn't even have time to wait for a manager. The only CPK near us went out of business, so we rarely get a chance to treat ourselves to the food we used to enjoy regularly.

My efforts to find a small locally owned hidden gem proved to be futile, and I soon found myself in what I presumed to be suburbian hell capitalized with endless chain restaurants.
Luckily for me, Leo was about to change my views on chains and turn me into a California Pizza Kitchen fan for life. 
If you ever decide to do an episode 'Undercover Boss', have them shadow Leo. He said he'd been working there for many years... But he was so passionate about the food you would think he just started working there. 
He was so cool! Not at all the cliche chain restaurant waiter that I had grown accustomed to suffering second hand embarrassment from.

Once the food finally arrived about 20 minutes after I had ordered it was cold.  The waitress only interacted with me twice: taking the order and bringing the bill.  I was seated right next to the host desk and it seemed as if I was being deliberately ignored.  I left completely disappointed in the entire dining experience.

I've been eating at various CPK's for a number of years now, multiple times a month, I don't want to feel like I have to constanty have a chore when i go home filling out surveys.   My spending my money there is enough of an indicator that i enjoy dining there.   I enjoy being waited on by multiple members of staff and do not see how the survey being carried home, remembering to log on to my PC and then fill out the survey is any indication of a servers ability to do their job.

However, I was extremely shocked and disappointed to see that their frozen pizzas contain trans fat. It has become quite public how bad trans fat is for your health and I'm shocked that CPK has not taken more of an initiative to eliminate them as almost all major food establishments have. What's more disappointing is that I wrote to them about this problem and they never responded to me. Good pubic relations?? I don't think so.

This might make you think twice now before you go to the frozen food section and grab one of their artery-clogging/heart-killing $5.99 pizzas. It's not worth the risk to me.",,status,,2010-07-30 00:17:31,0,1,0

I do have two complaints however;
1. The pepper shaker holes are way too small for the pepper being purchased.
2. Stop serving fish on a cold plate. Cold plates suck the heat from water based products like fish and the veggies in no time. Half way though the meal; it's cold.

79746038702_260846253702,Re the frozen pizzas:  please see Bite of the Best to get comments on the horrid change in the frozen pizza crust.  Kraft claims there was no change although CPK admitted the change and said the old recipe will be resurrected because of comments from dissatisfied customers.  I bought a DiGiorno flat pizza in desperation and found same terrible crust and then saw on the box that Kraft is the distributor.  They are using some mass produced cardboard version of a flat crust.,,status,,2010-01-18 13:40:53,0,4,0
