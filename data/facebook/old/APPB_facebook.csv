84917689333_10156123330424334,"b'I am not one to complain on social media, but my attempt at dinner tonight at your South Boston, VA left me incredibly upset. My complaint is long winded, but I felt you should have all the details. I am a mother of 17 month old twins, and, needless to say, we don\xe2\x80\x99t go out to eat often-maybe once or twice a month- so tonight was a treat. \n\nWe arrived a few minutes after 7pm as part of a party of 8 + two in high chairs and were seated promptly in a large corner booth, as the restaurant wasn\xe2\x80\x99t full. \nWe had to ask for high chairs again 20 minutes later, and when they arrived two servers told me they couldn\xe2\x80\x99t have high chairs in the aisle and moved us to the booth directly beside our group. Ok, no big deal...so we moved the 4 of us over. I ordered a tea and French fries to keep the twins busy because dinner was impromptu and I had come straight from the babysitter and had no snacks in their bag. Thankfully, those made it to us. \n\nApproximately 40 minutes after we ordered, and 10-15 minutes after my husband had to walk over and ask the hostess to help us get our check because of the lack of service, his salad arrived. We had already packed up the diaper bag, and I had gotten one of the twins out of the high chair and sat him in my lap while we waited to pay for the untouched salad, tea, and fries. The beer my husband ordered when we sat down, along with our appetizer, had never made it to us. Let me interject at this point that our twins were still I good spirits and had not been fussy, which is always a plus when you\xe2\x80\x99re going out as a family. \n\nRight after the salad came my entree, and I was going to ask for a box, but when our server brought it and rudely dumped it on our table, she disrespected my family by saying loudly enough for several tables to hear, in regards to the twin still sitting and the two high chairs, \xe2\x80\x9cThese things are in the way!\xe2\x80\x9d and pushed the empty one angrily (but wait, she\xe2\x80\x99s one of the two servers who moved us from one booth to the other...)\n\nAt this point I became very upset because her actions not only were uncalled for, but several tables started looking over at us. I stood up with the baby in my lap, grabbed the diaper bag, and walked to the waiting area by the front door to wait on my husband to pay.  It was at this point that twin started crying, so I walked out to put him in the car. \n\nMy husband\xe2\x80\x99s entree came as I was standing up to leave, and he told the server we were leaving and that he wanted to pay for the tea and French fries we ate, like he told the hostess 10-15 minutes before we got any of the entrees. A server called a manager over, and he told my husband we had to pay for it all because it was \xe2\x80\x9calready prepped.\xe2\x80\x9d So, my husband asked to have the two entrees boxed, to which he was told they couldn\xe2\x80\x99t because his entree had already been taken back to the kitchen. As the final blow, he was told we had to pay for it all, even though we had been trying to get the check well before the entrees arrived at our table. \n\nSo, nearly an hour after we had been seated, we went home $25 lighter, with no meal to show for it.'",,status,,2018-02-10 04:00:18,1,2,0

In fact, the shrimp were basically brown popcorn shrimp drizzled with a small amount of a Chipotle/Southwest ranch type sauce. They were horrible and we sent them back.

I\'m not kidding, after being told by her hostess and my asking if that had been relayed, she wanted me to say it again.  I asked her if she was baiting me.

It is absolutely disgusting that you're allowed to smoke inside a restaurant, especially when there are children around. We were all coughing, and couldn't really enjoy the time we had with family. This is a family restaurant and we will not be coming back until there's no smoking in the building. If we wouldn't have already ordered, we would've left when we realized you could smoke there.

We had been to the same location a few nights before and our waiter and the manager present were extremely friendly and were open minded to the situation about her ID.... well the manager working on NYE and our waitress were extremely RUDE. Upon being seated we explained we wanted drinks and put in our food order. The waitress asked us for our IDs and we explained that my cousins ID was from South Africa. She immediately became very condescending and went and got the manager. The manager came and my cousin (who has an extremely strong SA accent) tried to explain and he didn\xe2\x80\x99t seem to understand so i began to explain. I explained she was visiting and had her SA I.D and he refused to look at it. Then after arguing with us for a few minutes i told him she had her passport but he still refused to see anything that wasn\xe2\x80\x99t American. He said it was all pretty much fake and if it wasn\xe2\x80\x99t American he wasn\xe2\x80\x99t trying to see it. He also said and i quote \xe2\x80\x9c i don\xe2\x80\x99t know the laws in South Africa so i can\xe2\x80\x99t serve you any drinks\xe2\x80\x9d.

AND the laws in SA say you can drink once you\xe2\x80\x99re 18. So it STILL wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t matter. So long story short, the service that night was HORRIBLE.

My perfect margarita was served with no napkins, straw or pick for the olives, and only half of the glass rim was coated with salt, and it was served with a very thin slice of lime. How are you supposed to squeeze a slice of lime?\nWhen I unwrapped the silverware, my fork was dirty, something green and dried on the fork.\nThis made the whole dinner off kilter, so we ordered my ribs to go. As soon as they arrived, we left.

She said they'll start cooking it right then, but by that time we were done waiting and went and grabbed fast food. The time before that there was a long piece of hair in my food. As soon as the waitress set it down I saw it and so did she. She was as grossed out as I was. She apologized and said they would remake my order. By the time my plate was brought out everyone else was done eating though. Tonight I ordered the 7oz Parmesan and shrimp sirloin with grilled vegetables and mashed potatoes. As soon as I cut into it it was tough. After hacking away at it I saw it was ALL GRISTLE! I tried to find spots on this small steak that weren't tough but couldn't.
