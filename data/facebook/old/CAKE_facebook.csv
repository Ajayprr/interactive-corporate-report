I ordered cashew chicken and there weren't any cashews and the chicken was one burnt brick of stuck together chicken.  My friend ordered a turkey burger and they brought her a dry beef burger.  We asked for the manger again and he was sarcastic and rude.  He said,  i don't know what you want me to do.  We aked for a comp as we were not waiting for another hour for a nee entree to be cooked.  He said he would comp the entree but not the entire meal.  At this point the 3 tables that came after us were leaving and had already paid.  The table next to us spoke up and after multiple tables spoke up the manager comped the meal. both the server and manager were incredibly rude and should not be in customer service.

I have to say we were left with a pretty bad impression. \n\nAfter we waited over 45 minutes for our table I went to the restroom to wash my hands. I soaped up my hands, but then not one of three sinks were working. I found a manager and after about several minutes he was able to get a tiny trickle of water to flow from one of the sinks, and I could finally rinse the soap from my hands. When I returned to the table my husband showed me his napkin which had four long black hairs folded into it. At this point we were turned-off by our Cheesecake Factory experience, and decided to leave. \n\nI thought we should let the manager know the type of impression his store had made on us. We informed him of the problems and our concerns over health safety, because of no working water in the bathroom sinks, and then by the careless attention put to the assembly of the napkin/flatware. While the manager was polite, he was quick to brush us off. In fact, he made it clear that he didn\xe2\x80\x99t care or take our complaint seriously by simply saying \xe2\x80\x9cthank you, have a nice day.\xe2\x80\x9d Really? No acknowledgement of these problems, and you are happy to have this be a customer\xe2\x80\x99s first impression of your company? There wasn\xe2\x80\x99t even a sign to let customers know that there is no running water in the bathroom. How do employees wash their hands? \n\nWe wasted over an hour at your store. We were left with a poor impression of how the store runs.

When I finally got my food (lemon herb roasted chicken) the first piece was a little pink. When I asked if that was normal they said that the roasted chicken is sometimes a bit pink, but it is cooked. I finished the small wing piece, I cut into the larger piece and it was bloody. (My father in laws steak was also closer to rare than his requested medium well done.) My food was then taken back to the kitchen. 10 minutes later the manager came by asked me if I was okay and if I wanted another meal made but it would take close to 25-30 minutes. I declined and just asked for a cheesecake slice instead. I never saw the manager or server again untill I was brought my check, which still had the bloody chicken entree charged, and was never brought a slice of cheesecake in compensation. On top of that when I payed for my check I was expecting $3.23 back but the server so graciously took my change for herself and only gave me my $3.00.

She informed me that \xe2\x80\x9cpolicy\xe2\x80\x9d said we could not be seated because all 6 of us were not there. Two were at the bar closing out our check and one was in the mall because, as a 73 year old, he needed to sit. YOU do not have anywhere near the seating needed for waiting guests.\n\nAre you kidding? Do you really expect everyone to be there immediately upon beeping after three long hours? My lord, I wonder why the fire marshals have not ordered you to clear the doorway of scores of people waiting to be seated. Your food staff had huge difficulty navigating the immense crowd. Think guest safety. When Saturday night crowds are big and it is 10 degrees outside, perhaps you can isolate a better waiting area.\n\nEverything about The Cheesecake Factory gets high marks, but not your corporate policies or customer accommodation.

But he had the unfortunate task of having to help us find things in stock. Apparently, they are ""between management"" and have run out of quite a few items. We tried to order several items but couldn\'t. The restaurant was out of cod for fish and chips, chicken samosas, and all steak(s). He assured us they\'d be getting a deliver tomorrow. But that did us no good tonight. \n\nThe food we did get to order was delicious as usual. Sam was attentive and helpful.

Arriving at 4 p.m. we expected some wait but...! I guess this one is doing so well that they can ignore a group who had been sitting for over an hour (knowing that the wait was 60 minutes for a group) and then proceed to tell them that they have to wait 20-30 minutes longer.  During our wait, there were at least 30-40 groups that came in after we arrived, that were seated first.  And the excuse was that they couldn\'t get any tables to put together.  Of course they couldn\'t because they kept seating the newcomers.  For some reason, management decided that if they made us wait long enough, there would ""magically"" appear a whole group of tables together.  I don\'t know what ""LaLa Land"" they\'re from but after being treated shoddily for the last time, we left (15 of us) and were seated at another restaurant in 8 minutes (long enough to put tables together and bring out water and menus). Incidentally, the food was absolutely delicious and less than half the price.  Good service and great food--don\'t know why we didn\'t go there first.

106628409154_10155037381654193,"b'Hi. My husband and I were in the Omaha location today, and we\'re celebrating our anniversary. It was not the experience that I expected. I\'m writing because, even after talking to the manager, we were not satisfied. \n\nWe were seated at a table that had dirty silverware on it. We ordered the herb crusted salmon and steak Diane combo. It seemed like it was taking longer than usual to arrive, but when it did, it was clear that our Well Done request had been ignored. Our server took it back. When it came back to us, it was CHARRED BLACK and tasted terrible. My husband indicated to the manager that it seemed as if someone had intentionally over cooked it in frustration of it coming back. The manager told us that ""if that was the case, they would be terminated on the spot"" and ""we just don\'t tolerate behavior like that"". Which, was merely lip service, as even we know that it couldn\'t be proven if that was the case. Although, I\'m certain it wasn\'t even followed up on. The manger offered cheesecake menus, and told us she\'d return. We ordered, it was comped and we never saw her again. \n\nThe Cheesecake Factory is a big name.  It\'s hard to imagine with as many nice restaurants that Omaha has how this kind of thing is being tolerated.\n\nPictured: The only part of our visit that wasn\'t disappointing.'",,photo,https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10155037381654193&set=o.106628409154&type=3,2017-05-21 21:13:19,6,5,0

106628409154_10208586767419205,"b""Hello! I feel I needed to write a message about one of your employees who Is hands down one of the nicest people I have ever met! In April I was over to Kuwait visiting my parents. On 21st April 2017 my parents and I visited The Cheesecake Factory in Mahboula, Kuwait. My parents had visited The Cheesecake Factory, The Avenues Kuwait a couple of weeks before and had told me how great it was so when we were going out for my fathers birthday meal we decided that's where we would go! It was my first experience here. When we got to the door we were met by Margarita who's bright and bubbly personality was a lovely welcome. She not only helped us choose our food but gave personal advice. Margarita and us shared information about our lives and by the end of our meal we felt that she was our friend. With it being my fathers birthday, Margarita came out with the other staff who sang happy birthday and gave my father a piece of Cheesecake with the plate decorated and personalised. It was very nice. We left feeling stuffed from the wonderful food and happy from our chat with Margarita. \n\nOn my last night Friday 28th April 2017 we decided that we would return. We had another server this night who was very nice but we were looking out for Margarita. Much to our delight she appeared shortly after arriving. Even though she was not serving us, between dealing with her own customers, she always found time to come and see us. She was an absolute gem! Food was also really tasty. The meal was ended with such a lovely gesture! Margarita gave me a lovely send of with Bon voyage on my plate with a piece of cheesecake. I was so full I couldn't eat it and she kindly let me take it away! \n\nI feel I needed to tell you about Margarita as she is such a brilliant person and an incredible asset to your team. She not only made my first experience of The Cheesecake Factory absolutely fantastic but her personality, kindness and genuine nature towards us was one of the main reasons we went back for my final night. I hope this reaches Margarita and I hope she receives the credit she deserves. When I return to Kuwait I will most definitely be visiting again and very much hope that Margarita is still part of your 'family' - how Margarita described it felt to be part of The Cheesecake Factory \xf0\x9f\x92\x97\n\nThank you,\n\nYasmin Gerrard x""",,photo,https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10208586767419205&set=o.106628409154&type=3,2017-05-10 14:09:50,13,3,0

106628409154_10207577441707764,"b""Shocked and Appalled here\xe2\x80\x99s why:\n\nOur family has loved the Cheesecake Factory for 20+ years.  We eat out ALOT, usually at least 2-3 times a week from the Cheesecake Factory.  Our typical receipt is $125-$150 having said that last night's experience with the Cheesecake Factory was beyond atrocious.  We don\xe2\x80\x99t even live close to a Cheesecake Factory so we rely on takeout and travel 20-30 minutes each way to pick up our orders.  Last night a flat tire made us a little late in picking up our take out order.  Last nights order was 3 appetizers 2 entrees and 3 desserts and cost over $100.  Both entrees were made incorrectly and were completely wrong.  The chipotle chicken pasta consisted of dry pasta with absolutely no sauce what so ever.  In fact it was so dry you could put your hand in it and it would come out clean (see attached photo). This dish was ordered with extra sauce and somehow we got it with NO sauce making it inedible.  The second entree was another favorite of ours the jambalaya pasta it had no flavor what so ever;  we didn\xe2\x80\x99t even recognize it and we order it all the time.  Since the appetizers and desserts were for the kids, my husband and I were left with no dinner.  We called the restaurant for help but received none.   The manager (Holly?) chastised us telling us that if there was anything wrong with our meals it was our fault (yes I\xe2\x80\x99m serious she really said this).  She said because we picked up our order 30 minutes late all the sauce from the chipotle pasta must have \xe2\x80\x9cevaporated or soaked into the pasta and disappeared\xe2\x80\x9d.  She began to yell and said this was not their fault, it was ours.  Her ranting went on in excess of 5 minutes non stop;  we couldn\xe2\x80\x99t get a word in edgewise.   We have never encountered this level of rudeness from a restaurant, ever.   Finally we gave up and got off the phone disappointed and furious.  This woman should not be managing a restaurant or dealing with the public in anyway.""",,photo,https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10207577441707764&set=o.106628409154&type=3,2017-05-05 14:54:04,7,9,3

106628409154_1641332049227752,"b'You know, I never wrote a bad review of this place before because the place is beautiful inside, the food is delicious and well plated, and the waitresses/waiters are usually very nice too. But I have had multiple issues with this restaurant and this one was the straw that broke the camel\'s back. \n\nWe had a perfect afternoon eating here and great food and service until we got the bill. I looked at it and they charged $8.50 for our strawberry cheesecake (no, we didn\'t need to add to our body\'s abundant fat reserves but it was my parent\'s anniversary). Yet all their menus showed the price was $7.95. \n\nSo I told the waitress I knew it was splitting hairs but it\'s the principle of the thing and she understood that and went and talked to her manager. While I realize I\'m having a lunch that costs more than your usual fast food or sandwich, I\'d still be a spoiled fool to act like 55 cents meant nothing. \n\nShe came back and basically said ""I\'m sorry about that, but we raised our prices and our system is in transition is that okay?"" Nooo it\'s not okay to be lied to about this. I told her no and she went and told the manager. The manager came back and told us the same thing.\n\nFirst off, this shouldn\'t have been an issue to begin with; they should have correct pricing on all their menus at all times. Second, they should have corrected the error for us immediately. Third, you should never tell a customer some excuse and still make the customer responsible for it. I told him as such and he just looked at me and shook his head as if to say ""sorry you don\'t like it but tough luck we won\'t change it for you."" Sure enough, they didn\'t change it on the bill they brought back. This is misrepresentation and illegal. You\'re lucky we didn\'t walk out completely. \n\nI mean here\'s the bottom line: YOU squabbled with a customer for 55 cents. You lost a customer. OVER 55 CENTS. Petty, petty restaurant.\n\nOh and I forgot to mention, on our way to the parking two valets nearly backed into us!\n\nPart 2:\n\nThis is actually a prequel to today\'s fiasco. A few months ago a friend and I went to eat here. Her and my favorite appetizer is the avocado eggroll plate. We ordered a plate of them but were told they were out of avocado even though we saw other plates of food being served with avocado. It must have been another issue with the eggrolls themselves but either way we were very disappointed. Now some background - I live a half hour away from this Cheesecake Factory so to go there is a special trip. A week later I called and asked specifically if they now had avocado eggrolls in stock and available to order to go. The person on the phone said ""we sure do!"" very confidently. So I took a trip down there, I went in and went to the to go counter to order, and they told me they still didn\'t have them available. This had me steaming. Obviously no one in this restaurant commmunicates with each other. Well I went home and wrote a complaint through the website. A while later I got an apology letter and a gift card from the manager. I figured at this point that at least the communication problem would have been addressed. So a week later I call, and I ask the same thing. They tell me the same thing they did when I called before: ""we sure do have them available!"" Well guess what? I drive down there and they\'re still unavailable. HOW IS THIS POSSIBLE!? You can probably guess how upset I was, and of course I complained online again. I didn\'t get a response for a couple of months in the form of a letter from the manager asking me to call him. Well I kept calling and every day someone told me that he had \'just\' left. Yeah right. Just awful, I\'m done.'",,photo,https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=1641332049227752&set=o.106628409154&type=3,2017-04-09 23:57:11,2,7,0

I asked for a cheesecake with strawberries but no glaze and Amy told me no, even though I get it like that every time I go. I had to ask for a manger twice. I explained the situation to the manager and he then told her which prompted her to come over and yell at me in front of my 7 year old about how the cheesecake was pre made in the morning, and when I said what about the items you didn\'t give us her response in front of her manager was ""I FORGOT"" they took our cheesecake off the tab and an appetizer. I wrote a letter and the manager called me this morning to tell me that Amy had been written up but he feels that they went above and beyond by giving us free cheesecake slices and taking off an appetizer and that was all he could do. \n\nWhat was the point of calling me Mike? Just to tell me you wrote Amy up? You didn\'t go above and beyond. Above and beyond would\'ve been giving me a refund and sending me a gift card.

What the heck is wrong with people? I came on to share my WONDERFUL experience and to see that some people take the time to complain about any silly thing and post such petty nonsense is disheartening!\nJust left the Cheesecake Factory Southside works in Pittsburgh. They were ridiculously busy like usual on the weekend. RIDICULOUSLY! Even with more people than I've ever seen waiting to eat in my life they seated us quickly considering! \nMy server was DJ. He was so pleasant that he actually pulled me out of a bad mood! Cheerful, warm and upbeat. He was probably one of the best servers I ever had! Super quick, constantly checking, quickly correcting if he missed something or felt he took to long (which he didn't). The staff worked in tandem. DJ would be busy working the hundred people there and others would bring out food as it came. It was mind boggling that they are able to deal with so many people so efficiently. \nDJ was so sweet to my husband and grandson. My husband got the potato soup which DJ said was delicious and my grandson took one bite and wanted some too. My husband asked if there was a cup smaller for him.  DJ was back in two seconds with a perfectly miniature bowl of soup. Needless to say they were both very happy. But this was just one of many great dinners at Cheesecake at Southside Works. Thank you Cheesecake Factory! Please recognize this restaurant and server for the great job they do!

Why? Because they were carrying their sidearms.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey had seated us in the back area,\xe2\x80\x9d Miriam Nichols told KIRO Radio\xe2\x80\x99s Jason Rantz. \xe2\x80\x9cShortly after the rest of our party arrived, we were asked to leave because we were carrying our firearms with us. They said they did not allow firearms in their establishment.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nThe group was seated in the back of the restaurant, Nichols noted. They avoided making too large of a scene as the officers showed their badges and law enforcement identification to the Cheesecake Factory managers, explaining why they \xe2\x80\x94 as officers \xe2\x80\x94 had guns on them.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey said it didn\xe2\x80\x99t matter and they asked us to leave,\xe2\x80\x9d Nichols said. \xe2\x80\x9cWe left quietly and tried not to make more of a scene than it already was.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nCheesecake Factory management was polite, she said, and weren\xe2\x80\x99t trying to be rude over the situation.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere are only so many ways to politely kick someone out of an establishment, though,\xe2\x80\x9d Nichols said.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI was a little floored that it was even happening,\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cThis wasn\xe2\x80\x99t the first place that my colleagues and I have gone to lunch \xe2\x80\xa6 having contact with clients, offenders, the general public, while on duty. This is the first time we had this reaction.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nCheesecake Factory responds\n\nThe incident at the Tacoma Mall Cheesecake Factory made its way onto social media where it garnered considerable attention. Nichols said that people responded to it with outrage and disbelief.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s kind of given that law enforcement carry firearms,\xe2\x80\x9d Nichols said.\n\nIt didn\xe2\x80\x99t take long for the Cheesecake Factory\xe2\x80\x99s corporate level management to respond.

106628409154_1289447214410827,"b""I chose to leave work doing sales and IT customer consultation at a very popular electronics store in order to get into the restaurant business. I always wanted to learn to cook but I continuously heard that working in a professional kitchen is one of the hardest jobs you'll ever do and it just isn't for most people. \n\n I decided to take a risk doing something I felt like I might fail at, and it was the best choice I've ever made. I'm terrible at interviews and I had no experience but our EKM, Jerry, took me on my word that I had enthusiasm and a thirst to learn something new. He's usually a buttoned-down type of guy but he'll let you show him if you're going to keep your word and that really makes a difference.\n\nI started as prep cook and did hands-on training with several of our awesome workers and I slowly learned how to make all the recipes. It took a month to really get the feel, and significantly longer than that to actually become good at turning all the food out as timely as is necessary. \n\nIn that time I met some of the most down to Earth, qualified and, most importantly, caring people I'd ever met. I don't believe any of the guys would ever say that they're any of those things, but I feel like they are and even when they were all in sour moods and nothing was going right they still made absolutely sure to get things done and keep the ship floating.\n\nBecause I learned a ton and because Cheesecake makes all of their recipes by hand it was the perfect way to see how much I could handle and to prepare myself to work anywhere else necessary (given, if I was living in the right location I would have stayed at Cheesecake!) and feel confident. I had everything but the kitchen sink thrown at me and it was a blast! It's a very satisfying feeling to work your butt off on a holiday and to feel like your team got everything spot-on. I wasn't always perfect; not every day was beautiful, but I was continually supported by some seriously wonderful people.\n\nI just wanted to let Cheesecake know that our team in Boulder taught me what it was like to fight against the clock valiantly rather than to sit in an office staring at it boredly and I appreciate that so much.\n\nThank you: Our EKM Jerry, Store Manager Dustin, Scott Smith and Scott Lee and anyone else I haven't listed who knows they should be here.\n\nYou really, really made a difference for me and it meant a lot.""",,photo,https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=1289447214410827&set=o.106628409154&type=3,2016-12-20 14:16:05,4,1,0

We made a promise 100 years ago that we would never forget the sacrifices of a generation, so the ""Lest We Forget"" Mobile Museum is doing its part to bring their memories to those across our Nation. The effect that this experience has had on our Veterans, especially WWII Veterans, has been amazing. Being able to View the artifacts and pictures close and upfront with multi-media has triggered amazing responses as they share their own memories. Our website has a tour page listing locations as we book them. Also the website will share the complete story and purpose. Thank you for taking the time to consider this as it is a great way to bring our Family of Veterans together with a piece of History as we Remember.

Each card to be used for a free piece of cheesecake. The other day she found one that was still in her purse. Imagine the look on her face. She was quite happy and asked if I would take her to use the card.  The closest location is about 50 miles from me. We were in that area this weekend so I decided to take her.  We get to the Cheesecake factory to place our order. The manager looked my daughter in the face and told her there was no way she could use it. It's beyond the expiration date. I didn't think it would be an issue because there are countless restaurants that will honor a coupon after the expiration date.  Had I known they would not honor it I wouldn't have put my daughter in that situation.  Funny how a company would tell a 6 year old No over 1 slice of cheesecake rather than honor and have a cheesecake lover for a lifetime.  This slice of joy turned into a slice of sadness.

We had an outstanding waitress- I believe her name was Kristin.\n\n We watched as she was treated very rudely by another set of guests. All the while she kept a smile on her face, and a very positive attitude. As these guests continued to complain and their children ran into her (while she was carrying a full tray of food)- she just kept going, like nothing every happened. When they were leaving we overheard them complaining about Kristen among themselves. We even heard one of them say they were leaving her a $0.25 tip (the others offered no tip at all). We are not sure what type of tip Kristin really accepted from those guests.We watched in awe while she cleaned up their mess and kept moving. We talked to Kristin for a bit- found out that she used to be a teacher, and that she loves working in customer service. \n\nWe give you mad props Kristin! You are a Rock-Star! Great Service!!

Despite our best efforts and communication with the waiter and kitchen staff, our daughter (5 at the time) was exposed to eggs by the bread on the table and had an allergic reaction. We hope you make strides to make customers more safe by having allergy menus and greater staff training for food allergies. We can't go to your restaurants until they are safer for our daughter.

It was our 46th. And it was our last. My precious husband was dying of pancreatic cancer.\nHe had to drink an energy drink to even be there, that evening. He could not hardly eat at all. When he went to the restroom, I explained to our waitress, who's name was Kelly. Let me just say.. Kelly was so very kind ! I broke down. She not only boxed up our food. She gave us our dessert, and an entire cake to take home ! She hugged us both, took our picture, took a picture of herself with each of us. Kelly and the Louisville Cheesecake Factory  did all they could to make our last Anniversary as good as possible, under the dreadful circumstances. I have had such a hard, grievous year without my dear husband, that I haven't been back to your store. I have meant to. I think often of your lovely place and sweet Kelly. I hope to see her again, one day. Thanks so very much for the kindness shown to us on that so important day in our lives. My husband passed away, sixteen days later. I cherish the memories you helped to make.\n                             Sincerely, \n                              Sharon Lewis""",,photo,https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=1009614399104922&set=o.106628409154&type=3,2015-12-15 10:25:30,14,3,1

106628409154_10207937994228292,"b""I normally think highly of the Cheesecake Factory....that is until Sunday brunch this morning. I ordered poached eggs on toast. The issue I had was that the poached eggs were cold - like from the fridge cold. Because the toast was warm, I made it through one of them before realizing something was odd. Coming from a different country my first thought was this is how Americans have their poached eggs. So I called the waitress who confirmed that it's not the way they're supposed to come. The manager promptly had another plate made up for me. When I asked him what the story was, he said that the kitchen normally pre-poaches the eggs and then puts them in the chiller. The cook is then supposed to throw them back into the boiling water for a quick heat up, only he/she forgot to do it. I only hope the one I ate was cooked well enough - guess I'll know in a few hours (stay tuned). The waitress was lovely and tried to get me a discount on the price of the meal, but the manager would have none of it - the original price stood. I guess his financial target was more pressing than customer satisfaction.""",,photo,https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10207937994228292&set=o.106628409154&type=3,2015-12-06 14:49:47,2,5,0

I expressed that I understood it was busy and we had a large party but seriously... I also explained that  we had long waits for both our seats and food but there would be no delay in the check coming... Nothing.

We were then asked to stand aside so they can swap it out for a new set, which again was covered in residue from previous use (this time red pepper flakes)! The finger was pointed at the busboys for not noticing then at the dishwashers (Managerial staff should take ownership of the problem, not deflect to individual staff). We raised a flag when we saw another table (a two top) with utensils also covered in residue and told them to switch it out before someone sat down (it was still dirty on our way out).

The place was crowded and that is no excuse to undercook food. That can be extremely dangerous, especially for pregnant woman or people with compromised immune systems and if they can't cook food to correct temperatures because they are rushing then they should not allowed to have that many people at the restaurant. My husbands food was also cold but he was obviously more upset about my food being raw and the fact that I am 8 months pregnant!

Chris asked if he could escort her instead, then gently took my mom's arm and slowly navigated her to our table while chatting with her - so sweet! (See picture.)\n\nAs we were leaving the restaurant, Chris spotted us and came over to ensure we knew there was an elevator - and then gallantly escorted us to it, making sure we were safely inside before saying goodbye. \n\nI haven't seen my mom treated so respectfully since my dad died.

I finished the arugula and then I see a beetle type bug or something on my chicken breast!  I lost my appetite immediately.  The manager came over, and took my plate off the bill.

I ordered a well done meat Kobe Burger and Cashew spicy chicken for the wife. \n\nIt was taking too much when the manager in turn appeared. She was nice and said they had ""ignition"" problems and the burger did not look good so they made another and will take a little longer. We waited a few more time and our dishes came. The Burger was burned on the outside and raw in the middle. The chicken sauce was strong but good. \n\nI waited the manager to come again and check everything was fine but she never came back. I left the burger almost intact. Later the the waitress came and asked me if I wanted a box for the burger, I told her how bad it was and that I was not happy. She just said....

I have had cealics disease for about 10 years now so eating gluten free is not a choice for me. I also work in the food industry so I am aware that things will be cooked around my gluten free food that have gluten in it, but this just seems careless too me! The only way i can picture this happening is them using a pot that was just used to make non gluten free noodles and then not washed, or them using a drainer that was just used for non gluten free noodles and then not washed. Regardless if my assumptions are right or wrong its frustrating to order takeout, get all the way home, start eating and find multiple non gluten free noodles mixed into my gluten free pasta :( It is hard to trust restaurants with making sure my food is truly gluten free to begin with but this just stinks! I hope cheesecake factory can work a little harder to make sure this doesnt happen to someone else!'",,photo,https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=850882834981917&set=o.106628409154&type=3,2015-07-20 12:58:06,5,3,0

They were pretty excited, having just come from their first Uechi-Ryu Karate Tournament where Connor earned a silver and Spencer earned a gold and silver.  \n\nThe boys were proudly wearing their new hardware when we entered your restaurant.  It was around 5:30, so it was busy.  We were told we would have about a 20 minute wait.  While we were waiting, a hostess and a waitress both asked the boys about their medals.  When we were seated (on the patio), a bus boy and another server inquired about the boys\' awards.  Each person, despite how busy the restaurant was, listened to the boys and were genuinely excited for them.\n\nWhen our waitress, Sara B, came to our table she asked as well. She even mentioned that she took karate as a child.  She was enthusiastic and really made the boys feel amazing about their wins.  She even made a big deal out of their ""celebratory drinks"", Sprite! \n\nI just want this positive experience to be noted.  Everyone of your staff with whom we met, went above and beyond to make the boys feel like celebrities. \n\nThank you to the Natick Mall Cheesecake Factory for helping us end such an important day for these 2 young boys on a high note.  \n\nSincerely,\n\nChristina Query Shea'",,photo,https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10203584676091331&set=o.106628409154&type=3,2015-06-14 05:28:04,40,1,1

I ordered Ln Grilled Salmon and Greek Salad.  We left at 17:07.  About an 1 hour later as I started to drive back to Long Island, I became nauseous.  I had to get off the highway to throw up two times before I made it to the White Stone Bridge.  Then when I finally reached home I vomited two more times.  It was a very dangerous ride home, especially since I had my 5 year old son, elderly grandmother and family dog in the car and it was a raining, dark and lots of traffic on the highways.  I do have a picture of one of the vomits.  I called and spoke with Craig at your Trumbull Ct location to let him know I was sick from my meal.  He told me he wasn't a doctor.  He said maybe I have allergies.  He said maybe I was sick from something I ate earlier or the day before.  He said he would keep my name on file. He said your company had a great record of keeping everything clean and at the correct temperature.   I told him I don't have allergies, I don't get sick, and I am not sick with anything such as High Blood pressure, diabetes etc.  I told him I got sick from my lunch and I spent good money and I want something done about it.  He said he would have someone call me from your corporate office.  Well it's almost 2 weeks and no one has called me.  I will be posting this message on your FB page and my FB page.  I am requesting a full refund for my meal.  Thank you. """,b'Welcome to The Cheesecake Factory',link,http://www.thecheesecakefactory.com/,2014-10-13 11:38:04,0,2,0

Your staff needs to learn how to clean a table, especially after a DIAPER, is left on the table. A couple was eating at your establishment around 7 p.m. and they left the restaurant abruptly because their child was crying. I looked back at the table they had just left and I saw a DIRTY DIAPER on the table. It took your staff 10 minutes to remove the DIAPER off the table that was right next to us. Not only did they take long to remove it from the table, but once they did, they NEVER wiped the table down!!! All they did was clear the table and then placed new silverware and plates on the table!!! Disgusting, totally against health code. My thing is if that's what your establishment does in front of your customers...what do you do in your kitchen!?! I demand a response and will proceed to report this establishment to the health department if I don't hear back. It was my brothers birthday dinner and we couldn't even eat after that.

106628409154_10154059923420296,"b""Went to the Orland park location and the service was not good at all. My family ordered their meals and I ordered the Sweet Corn Tamale Cakes. After we ordered and are waiting on our food, 10 minutes later the waiter comes back and says I am sorry we are out of Tamale Cakes, and gives me the menu. So while i am ordering my family have already began to eat their meals as they had came out already. I ordered the Cajun Jambalaya Pasta without any clam juice and no shrimp or chicken. My husband and I order this all the time. It is a really good dish. The waiter insisted they don't make it like I asked. I told him we get it all the time. He said well let me go and check. At this time my party was ordering dessert. Mind you I still haven't eaten. He comes back and says it looks like you were right we can make it. Okay 20 minutes later my dish came out and the vegetables were not cooked in the dish they were almost raw, also the pasta was stuck together. I asked for the manager and his name was Garth. He said I am sorry we will put a rush on this right away. 15 to 20 minutes later they come out with my dish and I immediately ask for the manager again. Garth comes back to the table. I asked him how was this even able to come out like this. I thought they had to inspect the dish before it comes out. He said well that is because you don't have any protein (meaning shrimp or chicken) in it. I explained to him I always get it like this without any protein. I left without eating because they couldn't get anything right. I wasted close to 3 hours in here for the worst service ever. Their was different kind of pasta in my dish as you can see in my picture, but Garth seems to think this dish was ok. He definitely did not seem like a people person. If my family hadn't already eaten I would not have spent money in this place. I give the dish back and he says I took off your bill. (WHAT???) Like he did me a favor. You suppose to take it off my bill if I didn't eat it and gave you the dish back right away. So my husband calls Alex the next day and he says he apologize for everything he did hear that some of the pasta dishes were messed up yesterday and the next time we come we should get good service. This place is a joke. Look at this dish. The noodles were still stuck together. Where is the sauce?""",,photo,https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10154059923420296&set=o.106628409154&type=3,2014-04-20 10:54:07,1,1,0

106628409154_740706069275875,"b""I must say that I am highly impressed with how one manager went above and beyond to switch my anger around. Before saying why though, here is the story. Last night was my 21st birthday and at first it was going anything but pleasant. I had a party of 16 with me for dinner and of course I knew it would be somewhat of a wait because of how big my group was and it was a Saturday. However I didn't plan on it being 2+ hours long especially since I was told 45 minutes. So I became upset that they were not keeping me in the loop as to the est on our table. I kept getting we are waiting on one table which just made me more mad. When it came to finally being seated our hostess disappeared before we got to our table. I had to find someone to figure out where we were suppose to sit down at. By that point I was beyond livid and told them this was the most chaotic service I have ever dealt with and essential ruined my birthday to the point I never wanted to go back.  Finally at our table are two servers came who did amazing on keeping up with us and remembering the little things. I apologized to some of the staff I went off on because it wasn't there fault. Now thinking that was that I made the most I could out of the night. After getting our drinks a manager who I hadn't spoke to came up and asked me how everything was I told him better now that we are seated. He apologized for how everything was but what he did next made me want to come back again. He asked my best friend and I what are favorite cheesecake was and we told him Oreo. After our entrees were collected a whole Oreo cheesecake came out for us with birthday candles and singing happy birthday. I wasn't expecting that and felt very thankful for how hard he and our servers worked to make our experience better. What made the icing on the cake though was him grabbing a pole to bring my birthday ballon that flew off as I was opening a present. I didn't catch his name but if I saw him I would recognize him right off the bat. I can honestly say that he and our servers are the reason I will be returning to Towncenter location in Virginia Beach, VA. So thank you Cheesecake Factory for hiring him and the two servers.""",,photo,https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=740706069275875&set=o.106628409154&type=3,2014-02-23 14:39:44,0,2,0

Each year we choose a different location and we have been in contact with corporate letting them know which location we will choose every year. We are hoping to get to the Dubai location at some point. \nTonight, we showed up to an experience that kept us with our mouths dropped. The staff actually prepared for our arrival with a box of chocolates and a card signed by all staff at the location. We then got beyond exceptional service by our waiter Keith and then the entire staff joined him to sing ""Happy Anniversary"" (and they were pretty good).\nWe could have not asked for a more perfect anniversary experience and love that  The Cheesecake Factory is a part of our Tradition. \nThank you from the bottom of our hearts!'",,photo,https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10153851880605599&set=o.106628409154&type=3,2014-02-20 21:04:52,31,4,0

I sent this letter last week via email twice with no response:\r\n\r\n  Today my wife and I visited your Sherman Oaks location expecting a clean and pleasant dining experience. Upon entering  the restaurant we were greeted by polite and friendly staff members and we were promptly seated. After spreading my dinner napkin across my lap, I noticed  some old food particles on one of my forks. This prompted me to check all remaining pieces of our dinnerware. To our surprise three of our four forks were not cleaned properly, the three of them still had dried food on them. Needless to say, at that point my wife and I decided that we would not be dining at Cheesecake Factory.  If it had been one dirty utensil I would have simply brought it to our server\'s attention and would have asked for a replacement. But THREE out of FOUR forks being unclean at the same table is uncalled for and totally unacceptable from any dining  establishment.\r\nAs we exited your restaurant, I spoke to the manager and told him about our experience as well as handed him the three dirty forks while being sure to show him the food on each of them. He replied that he was sorry and he would bring it to the busboy\'s attention. He also asked if we were still going to dine and I simply responded, ""No. My wife has already walked outside.""\r\n\r\n                           Sincerely,\r\n                                       Mr. & Mrs. Anceo Francisco, Jr.'",,photo,https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10201243341747728&set=o.106628409154&type=3,2013-12-16 23:48:48,3,5,0

I have a child with a medical disability and it is unbelievably important that I know what the carbohydrate count is in everything she eats. Neither my server nor the manager had any clue that federal law section 4205 of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act , signed into law on 3/23/2010, mandates that restaurants with more than 20 locations are required provide nutritional information. In fact, neither the server nor the manager seemed to know what ''federal law'' meant and both insisted that it was not state law that they provide such information.  Not being compliant or even aware of this law puts my daughter's health at great risk and I hope that you will educate your staff as to the law as well as make nutritional information available on request at all your locations. \n\n""",b'Food Labeling: Nutrition Labeling of Standard Menu Items in Restaurants and Similar Retail Food...',link,https://www.federalregister.gov/regulations/0910-AG57/food-labeling-nutrition-labeling-of-standard-menu-items-in-restaurants-and-similar-retail-food-estab,2013-07-10 10:43:27,2,1,0

I find metal in my food and you have the audacity to still charge me for my beverage? I contacted corporate and shared my experience. They sent me a $50 gift card. I am insulted. I had a service issue at your restaurant some years back and received a $50 card and now they try to take care of this situation the same with finding a piece of METAL in my meal?! Unacceptable!

Almost three years ago I went on a first date walking along the shores of Waikiki Beach in Hawaii with a man named Jason.  He asked where I wanted to go for dinner and I told him ""Some place that has tiki torches"" and out of all the places with tiki torches, Jason chose to treat me to a wonderful dinner at the Cheesecake Factory.  From that day forward we began a beautiful relationship filled with love (and cheesecake!) Just a couple days ago Jason took me for another walk along the beach of Waikiki and then at sunset he proposed to me!  It was the most wonderful thing, and to celebrate we of course went to the Cheesecake Factory for champagne, dinner, and cheesecake!

When I got my food and started eating I noticed a piece of plastic had been cooked in the food. I had to spit it into my napkin (see photo).  Once informing the waitress of the error the customer service went down hill. I had to 1. ask for my meal to be comped. 2. Was told if I got shrimp in the meal it would be an extra $5.  3. Not only did the waitress not put my reorder in immediately, but said she couldn\'t until the manager talked to me. Then it took the manager 10 minutes to come to our table! When I asked for two slices of cheesecake he said ""\xc3\x8f am already comping your meal!"" Obviously, he must have forgotten that I had just consumed some unsanitary plastic while at his restaurant! When I received my 2nd plate of plasticless pasta the portion size was much smaller than the first. The manager never came back to see if everything was okay.  And the waitress tried to charge me for a soda when I only had water.  Even if I did purchase a soda I should have never been charged due to the cook\'s mishap.  Besides the manager\'s customer service the overall service was terrible.  The waitress\'s helper didn\'t even put the baskets of bread on the table, but left it on the ledge of the booth.  We got to the restaurant at noon and didn\'t leave until 2:45pm!  Everyone at the table was just disgusted.  This place is not worth going to with such bad service.'",,photo,https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10100725071248504&set=o.106628409154&type=3,2012-12-18 17:09:45,6,24,0

106628409154_10151394634144155,"b' Three days ago, I visited the newly opened Cheesecake Factory in Kuwait and I was really surprised, shocked and distraught at how we were treated. So much so that I feel that I have to share with you what happened. \r\n\nThe staff, from the receptionist all the way to the manager were horrible, the attitude they gave us was not acceptable and the level of rudeness was unbelievable. \r\n\nWe were 8 people with 4 kids and I had booked a table for 10. They told us there will be an hour and half hour wait, so we waited until our table was ready. When we went in, the table that was set for us was for 8 and not 10 so I told our waitress that I booked for 10 and not 8. She answered in a  very rude and confrontational manner, saying: \xe2\x80\x9cNO you have booked for 8 and not 10!\xe2\x80\x9d Right next to where we were going to be seated, there was a small table that we could add but she refused so  I asked for the supervisor. \r\n\nThe supervisor came, and honestly, she was even more rude and told us \xe2\x80\x9cNO we can\xe2\x80\x99t add anything \xe2\x80\x9c. At this  point, my husband stepped in to try and find an amicable solution. He told her there was a misunderstanding with the booking and we need to add more chairs. She bluntly  told him to step out of the way as he was standing next to the \xe2\x80\x98free\xe2\x80\x99 table without saying \xe2\x80\x9cplease\xe2\x80\x9d.\r\n\nWe eventually managed to squeeze ourselves around the  table and only needed an additional chair. So my husband asked for 1 additional chair and the waitress, again, said NO (is that your customer service motto for Kuwait, \xe2\x80\x9cno\xe2\x80\x9d?), and an additional chairs will not be added to a table. \r\n\nI understand that the place was very busy and the staff were pressured but the ATTITUDE was horrible, they weren\xe2\x80\x99t friendly at all. They didn\xe2\x80\x99t understand the culture of Kuwait ,where we are served and welcomed in all restaurants. Your staff\xe2\x80\x99s attitude was extremely negative, rude, aggressive and so not welcoming or accommodating. They truly ruined the day for us ,they didn\xe2\x80\x99t care or apologize so I asked for the manager. All he said was \xe2\x80\x9cSorry Ma\xe2\x80\x99am\xe2\x80\x9d without trying to solve our problem. So we decided to leave and go somewhere else and guess what? no one cared ,they waved us \xe2\x80\x9cgoodbye\xe2\x80\x9d.\r\n\nI\xe2\x80\x99d just like you to know that my family, friends and I will not be going to Cheesecake Factory again, I know that they (and by default, you) think they don\xe2\x80\x99t need more customers as they are full but it is a such shame for a place like Cheesecake Factory to send a bunch of unprofessional, unskilled team to run the Kuwait outfit. I have been many times to Cheesecake Factory in the US and this is not the level of service I was accustomed to... \r\n\nI sincerely hope this will trigger you to improve, otherwise you won\xe2\x80\x99t last for long as no one can tolerate such a bad service on the long run. \r\n'",,status,,2012-12-11 01:23:26,2,9,0

106628409154_10151360925764155,"b""I had a very horrible experience at this location.  When I first called the restaurant to inquire of a large crowed the person on the phone said they had a hard time acommating large groups.  I had asked to speak to a manager and was hung up on several times.  I then spoke to a manager Nick who was very helpful and very professional.  I show up to the restaurant at 5pm and was seated very quick.  We had a group of ten ordered apps and entre apps came out fine, then the entres started coming out 30 minutes later one at a time but stopped at 5 entres then nothing for over 30 minutes.  I called the waitress and she said she would call the manager then he said they were busy but why would they bring out half the orders then so much time between the others.  We later found out they gave our orders to another table.  We didn't get our orders for over 45 minutes, needless to say we shared from the 5 we recieved and were pretty upset as when they came out they came out one by one 10 minutes between.  We had asked a passing waiter for a napkin and he seemed offended and was really rude.  We spoke to Nick and he seemed very sorry and did note how horrible we were treated.  We still decided to order dessert cause it was my Mothers birthday but that is was brought the final insult to the injury of the night.  45 minutes to recieve dessert they came out one at a time.  They sang happy birthday to my mother but did not finish getting us our desserts.  When we spoke to Rafaella our waitress she said that the bakery was in total disstress and that everyone was grabbing things, that's not what I want to hear don't think it's appropriate for customers to be informed of those situations.  My bill was over $400 dollars and I feel violated cause there is no reason I should pay that type of money and leave a restaurant hungry and as dissapointed as we did.  I and my employees order from this location almost everyday and in one night you lost me as a fan.  I will most likely never visit the Cheesecake factory ever again.""",,status,,2012-11-19 16:09:34,10,14,0

The hostess took our ""number of guests"" and turned to a co worker then a manager came over and hastily demanded us to follow. We were seated in the highest traffic area in the restaurant!! Seated in a both across from the waitstaff galley right outside the kitchen they sat a sling for my infants carseat. Kitchen servers repeatedly carried hot food directly over the top of my newborn and busy workers along with patrons forced their way threw the crowded area brushing by the carseat making it very unsafe. As I looked around and saw multiple tables unoccupied I began to wonder why we were placed there. The manager was going to other tables asking how their experience was but continued to avoid our table even though I was trying to get his attention. Our waitress even treated us as if we shouldn\'t be there, not giving us time to order, insisting we box our food before we were finished and not offering us time or the option to order dessert....cheesecake! I was unable to relax and enjoy my meal because I had to take my baby out of her seat and hold her to keep her out of harms way. \nI\'m just disgusted at this experience and unfortunately so is my 15 yr old who is beginning to be social with friends and says she will never consider that a place to go with groups or on dates!'",,status,,2012-09-05 21:01:09,13,21,0

As someone who will routinely drive 30 miles and spend $15-$30 on cheesecake simply because I\xe2\x80\x99ve \xe2\x80\x9cgot a taste for it\xe2\x80\x9d, I was stunned to be looked at and spoken to as if I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have been there had it not been for the promotion. The manager was grossly unprofessional, as he flat out told us he wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t honor the terms of the offer as printed. It was painfully obvious that he did not look at us and see two educated, intelligent professional women who\xe2\x80\x99d taken their children out to dine elsewhere and simply wanted some nice desserts. Instead what he thought he saw was some people taking advantage of a coupon who wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be back any time soon \xe2\x80\x93 if at all. Prior to tonight, it had only been 8 days since my last visit. Needless to say that will no longer be the case. The blatant disregard for customer service is an unmistakable sign that my money should be spent elsewhere \xe2\x80\x93 an establishment that serves RESPECT with their food.

106628409154_10150667903509155,"b'To whom it may concern,\n\nOn Feb 20th 2010 myself and Tal Avital went on our first date to the Cheesecake Factory at the Menlo Park mall.  We had met on match.com, and being I had never been on a Cheesecake Factory, I decided to ask her out to lunch and take her there as I always wanted to eat at one.  This was just day one of what now appears to be the rest of our lives.  To note, we spent over 4 hours sitting at that table including ordering / eating / paying the bill / and chatting.\n\nOn Feb 20th 2011, we returned to Cheesecake Factory to eat lunch the same way we did one year earlier.  We had the same meal, bang bang chicken and shrimp for me and meatloaf lunch portion for her.  It was the same meal, but we decided to change to a new location. This time it was the Wayne, NJ location. We decided that we will make it a tradition to go to a different Cheesecake Factory every year on Feb 20th for the same meal we had on that first date.\n\nMyself and Tal have been engaged since November 2011, and planning a wedding for August 26th 2012.  If it was not for that first date at Cheesecake Factory we would never be where we are today.  We are debating on how to incorporate Cheesecake Factory in to the wedding, aiming to take some pictures for an engagement album at the location in Edison, but we are not sure how to work it in to the actual wedding.  We would welcome suggestions.\n\nThis coming Feb 20th 2012 we will once again be eating the same meal we shared two years earlier, and once again will pick a new Cheesecake Factory location to visit.  The location is still to be determined.\n\nI thought to write this up and send it out to you as I felt it would be a good story to share with your company and corporate offices.  \n\nHere is to the rest of our lives together, and seeing how many Cheesecake Factory restaurant we make it to,\nJason and Tal.'",,status,,2012-02-09 10:32:44,3,7,0
