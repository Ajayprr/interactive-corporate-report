106027143213_10155350260188214,"b'I wanted to send out a special thank you to all the crew, especially Brianna (Server) and Justin (Cook or Manager?) of your Clarksville, Wilma Rudolph location.\n\nI have been under the weather for over a week and really wanted a nice evening out.  I decide on having a meal with my friend and her daughter.  And I am overjoyed to have paid over forty-four dollars for them to have a nice meal.\n\nMyself on the other hand, food and service was sub-par at best.\n\nFried pickles had more oil floating on them, then the Gulf of Mexico.  These appetizer were served with a pool of dirty grease at the bottom of the dish, enough to soak through the fancy paper served with them.\n\nAnd there was the same dirty oil splashed all over the plate and the outside of the server container.\n\nIf the pickles weren\'t bad or old enough, the cracklin they tossed in for good measure was hard and I bet just as chewy, as the gum stuck under the table.\n\nThen the buffalo chicken sandwich I ordered arrived and was sent straight back to the kitchen.  My friend is sitting there with a fresh rack of ribs and her daughter has a fresh burger with a properly cooked egg on it.  \n\nMe?\n\nI get a piece of roadkill, that was dark, pasty, dried out and had more age on it, then Betty White.  \n\nMost times, when I see such lack of respect for food and customers, I get up and leave.  I can\'t trust a cook who can\'t respect food, not to sabotage a refire.\n\nBut I was desperate to have a nice evening and stupid me, I sent it back.  \n\nRound two with the now, seriously dead bird, looked great when Brianna brought it back out.  Until closer inspection.  So, what they did, is take an old one, re-breaded it, re-fried it, re-coated it and brought that out to me.\n\nThose french fries coming out exactly 4 minutes after my second dead bird, makes me suspect, they used the same fryer to cook the chicken and the potatoes.  That is a big health no no.\n\nSo I wouldn\'t recommend any of your staff for any sort of cooking competition were the stakes are no higher then achieving a negative rating.\n\nI say your staff, because I had to think about how uncaring Justin was, when he came out and asked what was wrong and said he would fix my bill.  He never said what his title was.  For all I know, he was the toilet cleaner sent out to blow smoke up my knickers.\n\nBut I also had to think of the cold uncaring attitude I got from Brianna.  Starting from when we first arrived and she used the incorrect pronouns and called me, ""Sir""\n\nOf course I corrected her right away, but I don\'t think it helped.  Because shortly afterwards, she had the hostess follow me into the restroom and supervise me.\n\nWith me being a big woman, middle age with a hormone imbalance, she evidently decided her agendas, superseded human decency.  And your staff supported her like a Sunday morning choir.\n\nWell hallelujah and can I get an amen!\n\n Thanks Justin taking my meal off, so could just I pay to watch my friends eat a decent, nearly fresh meal.\n\nNow I only feel discriminated against. hungry, pissed off and angry. \n\nThere is too much hate in this world, for it to continue.  Especially on nights when we are just looking to disconnect from all the negativity.\n\nSo, once more Chili\'s of Clarksville, thanks a heap for the lousy service, the lousy dog food you sent me, thanks for the chipped tooth and thanks for perpetuating the demise of the human race.  With your food and your hatred. \n\nCordially;\n\nMs Ruth Cutler'",,status,,2018-01-21 04:54:48,1,1,2

106027143213_10155341795343214,"b""UPDATE: \nMy family went to Chili's December 31st for dinner. Even though there were a lot of empty tables, we were told that it would be 10-15 minutes because they were getting servers back on track??? We ended up waiting closer to 30 minutes and were about to leave since we had two four year olds who needed to eat, but then they seated us. It took another 10 minutes to get anyone to even take drink orders. One of my twins wanted a pepperoni pizza kids meal and the other wanted cheese. Another 10 minutes after ordering, the waiter came over and said that they didn't have any cheese pizza. So after some convincing my daughter, we ordered another pepperoni pizza. Over 20 minutes later, we finally got our food. My tacos were COLD. Everything on my plate was cold. I told the waiter and he said they could heat it back up. My husband had order crispy chicken crispers and got regular and wanted regular corn on the cob and they brought street corn. And they only brought one kids meal. After tracking down our waiter, the person who brought us our food came to our table with him and he said that they were also out of pepperoni pizzas. Didn't bother to bring her side or anything. Again, she's FOUR and we've been there for over an hour at this point. He said mac n cheese was the quickest if we wanted her to get food quickly, so we ordered that. After awhile, he finally brought that out but still forgot her side of broccoli... finally got it and it was cold also. He brought my tacos back out and the beans were still cold, even though I had told him twice that it wasn't just the tacos but that it all was cold. My husband got the correct corn and then we had to remind him again about the chicken being wrong. Eventually, we all got our food. We had to ask several times for more water, napkins, and silverware. Then once we got the ticket, we were charged for three kids meals. I had taken the kids to the bathroom while my husband paid and he didn't notice since we were in a hurry to get them home for bedtime. I brought the receipt by the next day and asked to speak to a manager. She was nice, but never once apologized. I gave her the receipt and explained everything and she said it would be taken care of in a few days since it was New Years and corporate was closed. She called me a couple days later and needed more info to find the ticket. I gave her the ticket number and server, date, total, what we ordered... After several phone calls, she said she had the info she needed and would fax it in and again it would take a few days for the refund to show up. It's been two weeks now and nothing has shown up. This is ridiculous. All we were asking for is to not be charged for a third kids meal that we never got. Honestly, the whole ticket should have been comped since there were SO MANY errors and the entire experience was awful, but again, we just asked to not be charged for a meal we never ordered or received. We used to love Chili's but the last several times we've been it has gotten worse and worse. I've lost all patience with the Hot Springs, AR location. If I don't see a full refund by Monday, I'm disputing the charge with my bank to get it handled that way.""",,status,,2018-01-18 02:19:52,1,2,0

One day, I went to go enjoy a delicious meal there, and came upon the horrific realization that it was no longer there. Yes, tragically, the ONE Chili's we had was in fact shut down. I have done some research, and I noticed that Sacramento, CA alone has three locations (I was blessed enough to be able to visit one of those locations recently). Okinawa, Japan has at least one location (on an army base) and Guam, which is located in the middle of Oceania, has a location. I would love to get some information regarding the closing of the Portland, OR location, and am wondering if there is anyone I can speak to about getting a new location in the Portland Metro area. I know it would be highly successful, due to the shocking continuing success of Applebee's.

106027143213_10155329890463214,"b""My family went to Chili's December 31st for dinner. Even though there were a lot of empty tables, we were told that it would be 10-15 minutes because they were getting servers back on track??? We ended up waiting closer to 30 minutes and were about to leave since we had two four year olds who needed to eat, but then they seated us. It took another 10 minutes to get anyone to even take drink orders. One of my twins wanted a pepperoni pizza kids meal and the other wanted cheese. Another 10 minutes after ordering, the waiter came over and said that they didn't have any cheese pizza. So after some convincing my daughter, we ordered another pepperoni pizza. Over 20 minutes later, we finally got our food. My tacos were COLD. Everything on my plate was cold. I told the waiter and he said they could heat it back up. My husband had order crispy chicken crispers and got regular and wanted regular corn on the cob and they brought street corn. And they only brought one kids meal. After tracking down our waiter, the person who brought us our food came to our table with him and he said that they were also out of pepperoni pizzas. Didn't bother to bring her side or anything. Again, she's FOUR and we've been there for over an hour at this point. He said mac n cheese was the quickest if we wanted her to get food quickly, so we ordered that. After awhile, he finally brought that out but still forgot her side of broccoli... finally got it and it was cold also. He brought my tacos back out and the beans were still cold, even though I had told him twice that it wasn't just the tacos but that it all was cold. My husband got the correct corn and then we had to remind him again about the chicken being wrong. Eventually, we all got our food. We had to ask several times for more water, napkins, and silverware. Then once we got the ticket, we were charged for three kids meals. I had taken the kids to the bathroom while my husband paid and he didn't notice since we were in a hurry to get them home for bedtime. I brought the receipt by the next day and asked to speak to a manager. She was nice, but never once apologized. I gave her the receipt and explained everything and she said it would be taken care of in a few days since it was New Years and corporate was closed. She called me a couple days later and needed more info to find the ticket. I gave her the ticket number and server, date, total, what we ordered... After several phone calls, she said she had the info she needed and would fax it in and again it would take a few days for the refund to show up. It's been two weeks now and nothing has shown up. This is ridiculous. All we were asking for is to not be charged for a third kids meal that we never got. Honestly, the whole ticket should have been comped since there were SO MANY errors and the entire experience was awful, but again, we just asked to not be charged for a meal we never ordered or received. We used to love Chili's but the last several times we've been it has gotten worse and worse. I've lost all patience with the Hot Springs, AR location. If I don't see a full refund by Monday, I'm disputing the charge with my bank to get it handled that way.""",,status,,2018-01-13 09:56:05,0,2,0

When they arrived they were not fully coated but heavily draped in the sauce, I took one bite and knew I couldn\'t eat it, it was just overwhelming.  My waiter came by I told him and I asked for the honey chipolte instead, he obliged.  The manager, Corrine came by to apologize to which I responded no need to do so because it was a taste issue, but I was impressed that she came by and did that.  I got my new crispers and because I started with a salad and ate most of my side before the crispers came I ended up not eating most of them due to being full.  I asked for a box, we boxed up mine along with my husband\'s leftovers.  We paid the bill, walked to the car and I realized I had forgotten my box of food, my husband went back in.  The table had been cleared he approached the host, he was stand offish and then said he ""thinks"" it got thrown out and he could make it again.  My husband returned to the car without the food and rather than waiting because it was getting late, I left and called Corrine.  She remembered me from the original situation with the crispers and felt bad.  She offered to reimburse me for my meal with gift cards, I thought this was acceptable.  I wanted to share my experience as a great one, but I do have one complaint.  Maybe rather than complaint a suggestion for better outcomes in the future.  Approximately 1 minute to a maximum of 2 had passed before my husband went to retrieve the food.  Rather than lose inventory twice from my taste buds, to the throw away and offer to remake it and now a third time from free inventory with the gift cards staff should not throw away leftovers that quickly.  At the very minimum a 5 minute hold or how about walk outside and TRY to look for the customer?  I\'m really disappointed that all that food went to waste because someone was too ""quick"" to assume nobody was coming back.  I can\'t even say the person was lazy because it was turned over so fast.  I also ended up leaving my server a $10 tip to say a big thanks for taking care of me and then I was furious that this happened, as I drove home I told my husband it was obviously not our server that cleared the table because he would have made the effort to get the food to us because of what had occurred.

We started life in 1975 as a small burger shack on Greenville Avenue in Dallas, and now we serve burgers, ribs and fajitas all around the world. As we\xe2\x80\x99ve grown, our menu has grown, until we ended up with 125 dishes\xe2\x80\x94about as many college football teams as there are in the NCAA. You could get everything from quinoa to mango tilapia at the favorite Chili\xe2\x80\x99s down the street, but we heard you ask us a question: \xe2\x80\x9cJust because you can be everything to all does that mean that you should?\xe2\x80\x9d So, after a lot of self-reflection, we\xe2\x80\x99ve realized something you may already know \xe2\x80\x94 in restaurants as in life, you just can\xe2\x80\x99t be everything to everyone.  We\xe2\x80\x99re making a dramatic change, and we wanted you to know first.\n\nSounds like we might be closing our doors, doesn\xe2\x80\x99t it?  Oh no no no no no.  If anything, we\xe2\x80\x99re kicking them down. We\xe2\x80\x99re cutting our menu by 40% so we can increase the quality and size of what we\xe2\x80\x99ve always done best: our burgers, ribs, fajitas. The roots that really make us, us.  We know you might miss one of your favorites, but we hope you\xe2\x80\x99ll give us a chance to show we can bring you the very best food, every time you visit.

Not only was I not greeted, I was not even acknowledged by a staff member in that time.  In fact, the bartender went so far as to purposefully ignore me when I waved at him to try to get his attention to notify a hostess that myself and 4 other guests were waiting for tables.  Then, after being seated, I was not served for 15 minutes.  The part that I did not understand is that this location was very slow at the time.  There were very few tables with patrons.  I ordered the Margarita Grilled Chicken and decided to have a side full order of shrimp because I like shrimp.  When the food came another 20 minutes later, I received 4 shrimp for a full order, each of which were the size of my thumbnail, and for the tiny shrimp the order said I would be charged 7.95.  To me, a total time to get my food of 45 minutes at a slow location, plus being overcharged for tiny (and less than advertised) shrimp is completely unacceptable.""",,photo,https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=3025898728852&set=o.106027143213&type=3,2017-06-06 18:29:54,2,6,0

I ordered the Southwestern Egg Rolls and Triple Berry Cake.  \n\nI realize that most menu items received rarely look exactly like the ones pictured on the menu, but, I do expect to receive ALL of, and ENOUGH of, the same ingredients as if I had sat down in your restaurant and placed an order.\n\nNow, this is the SECOND TIME this has happened; previous incident was about two months ago.  I didn't complain the first time because I thought it was a fluke; now I believe that this is standard operating procedure for To-Go orders:  'Rip-off the customer'.\n\nIn the attached picture, the top pics show what is on your website, the bottom pics show what I received.  Again, I realize that what I receive will never look as pretty as it does on the menu/website, but hear me out:\n\nSouthwestern Egg Rolls: I've had these dozens of times over the years in your restaurants and each time they have been CUT IN HALF and served on a bed of SHREDDED LETTUCE.  I received three uncut egg rolls with no lettuce....naked egg rolls.   (2nd time on a to-go order).\n\nTriple Berry Cake: I've also had this several times in your restaurant and it was fine, it had plenty of berries, sauce, and ice cream so the cake never ran 'dry'.  What I received to-go was not enough ice cream, four, JUST FOUR BERRIES in a little cup with NO SAUCE!  I could only eat about half due to the lack of sauce and not enough ice cream so the cake got 'dry'.  If you look at your website the same item is chock full of berries, sauce, and a nice heaping scoop of ice cream.  Once again (2nd time), I got ripped off.\n\nI had also ordered an entree which was mediocre but I ate it anyway because I was starving.  I spent, with tip to the person that retrieved my order, $34.  And I spent this amount the previous time as well.  \n\nAs an aside, back in November we had extended family visit us and we ate at the Danbury location one night.  When the server brought us our drinks I noticed that my soda had a big piece of lettuce floating in it.  It did get replaced but t really made me wonder if I was given a clean cup in the first place.\n\nChili's Management, I am asking you to please make this right.  I have the receipt for the most recent visit the other day.  I look forward to hearing from you asap.""",,photo,https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10210094184610823&set=o.106027143213&type=3,2017-05-18 23:18:47,1,1,0

106027143213_10155280621810762,"b'So, my ""thing"" here is the guac and chips (w/salsa). I\'ve lived and worked in and around Illinois, Missouri and Kentucky all of my life and recently moved to Virginia. So, it\'s safe to say that I\'ve eaten at Chili\'s restaurants in every one of these dates and I typically order the same thing across the board. I decided, this time, to ask about how fresh the guacamole was and I was told that it is made fresh at 11 o\'clock every morning; as is the salsa. I thought so, but just thought I\'d ask. This was because the last order of guacamole seemed as if it was almost frozen right in the middle. The employee denied this. \nAnyway, I got home and ate the first order of guacamole with a few chips and it was divine. I got to the second one in immediately noticed a big chunk of brown avocado. I thought that maybe this had turned after it was made, so I took it out and found more under it. When I looked around the edge of the bowl it was as if it had browned in some places, but someone tried to stir it all together and conceal the parts that had turned brown. I even mistakenly ate some of the browned avocado because a portion of it looked fresh on the top but when I tasted it and then looked closer, it was brown underneath. Disappointed doesn\'t even begin to explain what I\'m feeling. I am angry. You better believe that I will be talking to someone about this. I have added a lovely picture to show you just some of what I found. I wanted you to see it as it is tonight because it will probably brown more through the night, as avocado does, and I will be heading back to Chili\'s tomorrow.'",,photo,https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10155280621810762&set=o.106027143213&type=3,2017-05-06 21:14:51,0,0,0

106027143213_793010460863349,"b'Hi, this is the ""6 oz"" steak I was given. When we mentioned that it wasn\'t, we were told no, it\'s 6oz, it\'s just REALLY THICK. Your manager at the location on East Beltline, Grand Rapids Michigan was smug. I\'ve done diet prep for fitness and bodybuilding shows, and to help guys prepare for their fights in the ring. I said it was 4 oz. The manager challenges me and said , ""I can get a scale. Do you want me to get a scale and prove it."" I had started to say no, but his tone and attitude rubbed me the wrong way. So, I agreed. I told my family it was 4 oz, and I said when he\'s wrong he\'s going to say it shrunk during cooking. He got there, set the scale down, rated it to zero, and then tried to add a plate. I raised my eyebrow, and he then fared the plate to zero. Would you like to guess how much my $15 6oz steak weighed? Suspense killing you? 4.2 oz. He then said when you cook meat, it loses 25% of it\'s weight. Again, I delved into my 40 year life experience and said it\'s medium rare, so still quite pink, and 1.8 out of 6 is about a third of the weight. He was upset at this point and said, ""Fine, I\'ll take it off."" I explained that I didn\'t want it removed, that we would learn from the experience not order it again. He left upset and saying with his back turned and walking away angrily that he was taking it off. His attitude was poor, like the service that saw us get an appetizer, finish two drinks each for my son and I while the bartender told our waiter that my wife\'s drink, her first, would have to wait. More than 10 minutes later, we\'d finished the app, and the bartender who hadn\'t made one drink in that time, worked on his math with receipts,slowly. Eventually, our waiter went and found another young lady to make a margarita, but she didn\'t know how. So she started and then she too had to wait on the first belligerent bartender. About 45 minutes into our 1 1/2 trek to Chilis for dinner the bartender eventually told her what to do. This is the chilis we stop by once a month to. It has never been a crappy place to go. Until last night.'",,photo,https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=793010460863349&set=o.106027143213&type=3,2017-05-06 09:20:10,0,7,0
106027143213_10211041537411700,"b'Dear Chiiliheads. My name is Ben Maurice Jean Runyan and I wanted to share with you the impact of a true ""work family""environment at the store location of Chili\'s on 7335 Arroyo Crossing in Las Vegas, Nevada. The person in this picture is Norman Runyan (my brother), who over 12 years at the mentioned location served thousands of customers and trained and supported hundreds of employees. He even helped train our sister Chantal Runyan who has been at the mentioned location for several years.\n\nIn October 2016 our family learned that Norm was diagnosed with cancer. Due to his treatment regiment he was not able to work which he hated, for he loved working with his co-workers and listening to his customers. As the months grew his co-workers would visit him, talk with him and check up on him via commutation through his sister.\n\nDuring the last couple of months the disease spread quicker than any of us where aware of. On April 22 he was admitted into the ICU section. He had many complications due to the cancer which placed him bed ridden. During this time in ICU ward, many of his co-workers came by the hospital to visit with him, cheer him on, hold his hand and share stories of the impact he made in their lives. I truly feel that this positive energy and encouragement from the Arroyo Crossing Chiliheads helped him to fight harder.\n\nOn May 3rd, we got the news that his journey on this planet was over. Our family is sad to see him leave, but we are thankful he is not in any more pain. I am sure he was meet at the gates with his favorite friends- Shelly, Terrell, Snickers and Glacier, four dogs that he loved.\n\nThis is a shout out to all the wonderful staff at the Chili\'s located on Arroyo Crossing in Las Vegas. Chantal and Norm have said wonderful things about this staff behind their backs. Norm may have been a little rough around the edges, but once you got to know him you really understood that this was a man who believed in doing your job well and that the customer needs to be the focus of attention at all times. Thank you Chiliheads for being there during this difficult time and being a supportive family for Chantal Runyan.\nBen Runyan.'",,photo,https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10211041537411700&set=o.106027143213&type=3,2017-05-05 23:18:48,38,3,4

We have spent many occasions:\nDates, birthdays, family dinners, etc. So we decided to go there for our two year anniversary dinner. I ordered the fajitas and dipped and coated my steak in what I thought was queso... and when I started to eat the piece and swallowed it was coated with some sort of hot oil that burned my mouth and throat. I started grabbing the drinks at the table. I downed my drink, followed by my husband's drink, and my mouth was still on fire. Our server came and could tell something was wrong. She went and got me milk. She was very sweet and seemed to feel bad about it. I started to feel very nauseous as the oil was burning all the way down. I kept going to the bathroom to heave. Fortunately nothing came, but I ran to the washroom at LEAST three times. During that time they took away the food and remade it without the oil that had burned me. I tried to eat some of the food, but my mouth and throat hurt at this point, and my stomach was churning so I ate almost nothing of the remade food I just took it home in a box. Unfortunately from being so nauseated with the smell in the closed car I pulled over and threw the food out so I didn't throw up while I was driving. I was in so much pain after having an antacid and milk I stopped on way home and grabbed ice cream. That helped some. When I woke up this morning my throat is very sore and feels swollen. I was disappointed that the manager didn't come to speak to me. I was offered no type of discount. I kept telling her I didn't want the meal but she insisted it be remade. I was offered an apology, which I do appreciate. And one free glass of milk. \n\nPS My husband loved his steak.""",,photo,https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10156093440698136&set=o.106027143213&type=3,2017-05-03 07:56:36,12,10,2

Seriously? I think it\'s pretty obvious that it IS broken, there are EDGE pieces missing from a several inch portion, and the kitchen apparently just didn\'t want to get another cookie. My wife didn\'t ask for a manager because she doesn\'t like to be confrontational, so I am posting this to get a second opinion whether this cookie is ""whole"" and complete with no ""broken"" or unfinished edges, or is it actually broken with pieces missing and shouldn\'t have been served like the server thought.

106027143213_10212273184365991,"b'Thank goodness my parents were there with me. I needed something to get my mind off of the terrible service. Pathetic. In addition, I found out my mom\'s potatoes weren\'t cooked all the way through.....AFTER we were finished & she was on her way out. She is just too kind of a person to even say anything. I on the other hand, would have had no problem letting the server, or manager know. I\'m a server myself & therefore know 1st hand people have no qualms about letting a staff member know when there is an issue with their food. After all, you are paying for your meal AND you are paying for service. Not sure how some servers make any money, aside from their hourly whopping rate of $2.13/hr, but that\'s not my problem, OR my business. What is my business is making sure my parents are taken care of and treated with upmost respect, anytime they are in town & we go out to eat. \nBoth of them had to look for the server just so they could get refills on their coffee. That\'s not ok. When you ask for a to go drink because 98% of your original beverage is still in the cup, the least they could do for you is bring you a full, fresh one to go.....or be mindful enough to top off the 1/2 full/1/2 empty styrofoam cup your taking with you. Please remind your staff members it\'s always good to check back once the food has been delivered to the table. ESPECIALLY when you aren\'t the one who dropped it off. Treat your guests as you like to be treated when you go out to eat.....with RESPECT. ESPECIALLY older couples. You will be there too one day.....remember that. Just my 2 cents regarding today\'s visit. If you really want the remaining ninety-eight cents worth, feel free to contact me. I certainly hope our visit was credited to my rewards acc as I had to ask another server to bring our kiosk back to the table, because for whatever reason, the server took it away, after my parents were seated there.

106027143213_10212448167737626,"b""Anyone who knows me knows I am a frequent Chili's Grill & Bar patron. My daughter and I go so often that everyone that works there knows us. They know my favorite server, my back-up servers, what we eat, what we drink and I even have a regular table. That is why it was totally natural for me to involve Chili\xe2\x80\x99s with our fundraising efforts for the band organization of which my daughter is a member. After all, Chili\xe2\x80\x99s claims to be invested in their community with their \xe2\x80\x98Give Back\xe2\x80\x99 initiative. So in December 2015 we organized a fundraiser at Chili's Grill & Bar through manager Brad. We held the fundraiser as directed. Our members shows up in force only to be told after nearly 5 months of trying to get a check for our efforts that the fundraiser was not authorized or sanctioned and therefore not valid. We would earn nothing. WHAT?!? Attempts to get Chili\xe2\x80\x99s management to recognize they made the error not my organization and the fair thing to do was honor the commitment made by a member of their management staff, went nowhere. In total frustration I sent an email to Chili\xe2\x80\x99s corporate and received a call back from the local manager, Christopher Jones, within a couple days.\n\nHave you ever felt like someone was talking to you because they had to? This is how I felt when we spoke. CJ, who I knew before this contact from being a frequent diner at Chili\xe2\x80\x99s, spoke to me in a manner that reinforced my belief that he likely had no choice. He offered my organization $260.00 to make up for the fundraiser night that was unsanctioned. Further, he gave us the opportunity to hold another \xe2\x80\x98give back\xe2\x80\x99 night to raise funds for our organization. It was required that a flyer be presented at the time of service, either hardcopy or on a cell phone. We held the fundraiser on Wednesday, April 5th. Board members of our organization participated. Member parents and families attended. A separate organization, our prom mania group, held their meeting at Chili\xe2\x80\x99s that night to support our organization. Of course, my daughter and I attended. There were many that attended. Even with all that participation, I received an email the next morning from Christopher Jones stating: \xe2\x80\x9cIt wasn\xe2\x80\x99t a good showing last night for the GBN. We only had one guest show up for this night. I spoke with Dennis every hour on the hour to see how the turn out was going. Maybe we can setup another one for you on a future date. I am always available for you. My number is 504-205-0650.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nObviously, I could have been knocked over with a feather. The impression I received from Mr. Jones was totally accurate. He was less than enthused at having to contact me or work with my organization for this fundraiser. To date, I have yet to hear anything further about the $260.00 check I was supposed to receive; even though I asked to be told in advance once the check was released. Now the fundraiser we held and no less than 25 parties (that I know of personally) attended is yet again NOT RECOGNIZED BY CHILI\xe2\x80\x99S IN LAPLACE. Further contact to Mr. Jones will not be made. Instead, I sent another email to Chili\xe2\x80\x99s corporate and am waiting on a response. We will see how this goes.\n\nMy frequent visits to Chili\xe2\x80\x99s Laplace will cease. I will not patronize any establishment that cannot support my daughter or the organizations that I believe in when they claim this is exactly what they do. This Chili\xe2\x80\x99s does not. The falsification of the lack of our participation is deplorable, but offers a clear insight of their true meaning of \xe2\x80\x98give back\xe2\x80\x99. It means sucker people into coming to \xe2\x80\x98give back\xe2\x80\x99 their money to Chili\xe2\x80\x99s. This location (because I will not imply they represent the entire corporation) should be ashamed of their actions clearly demonstrated by twice taking money out of the hands of a non-profitable organization that\xe2\x80\x99s sole emphasis is on the musical education of children. Shame on you Chili\xe2\x80\x99s Laplace. Shame on you Christopher Jones. You don\xe2\x80\x99t have to worry about me coming to you again and your \xe2\x80\x98offer\xe2\x80\x99 to try again will not be taken up. Instead, it is time for me to show you my disgust and disappointment by boycotting your location and asking all member of our organization to do the same.\n\nTo all member of our Marching Pride that attended this fundraiser and feel the same as I do, please send your thoughts and concerns in email to brinkerguestrelations@epowercenterdirect.com and include Reference Number 1400927 to identify that we all stand together. If you feel so inclined, you may also contact Mr. Jones on his cell phone to let him know the mistake he has made. Chili\xe2\x80\x99s corporate should be embarrassed by the actions of this store and its management. Will I ever eat at a Chili\xe2\x80\x99s restaurant again? Probably. But I can promise it won\xe2\x80\x99t be in Laplace, La. Guess it\xe2\x80\x99s time to visit another favorite manager at her store in Chili's Grill & Bar Springs, LA.""",,photo,https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10212448167737626&set=o.106027143213&type=3,2017-04-09 16:50:58,1,0,0

Usually we have a great experience, but it seems you changed the way you cook the grilled cheese. My daughter barely ate her food and my son refused to eat his because it was so badly burnt. Is there a way to request to have a grilled cheese cooked in a pan and not open-faced in a heating unit/broiler? My son's grilled cheese was so burned it was peeling off from the unheated cheese underneath it.\nWe showed our server, who was very kind, and she took our plate and brought out a bowl of rice and more pineapple for my son, as I requested. The rice was nice and hot, but he started spitting out bites and I noticed that throughout the entire bowl of rice there were bits of completely dried chunks of rice. Seems that the rice had dried out in whatever container it was being held in in the kitchen and they just mixed it all together instead of throwing out the dried off sections first.\nThe food my husband and I received was good and the pineapple was fresh. I've never had an issue with the grilled cheese in our few trips to Chili's and I was very upset with how poorly they were made today - especially for the price. I'd love to know if it is possible to request having a grilled cheese made in a pan so that the cheese actually melts properly.\nThank you for your time.""",,photo,https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10100404214250211&set=o.106027143213&type=3,2017-04-07 23:49:52,0,1,0

I ordered the cheese enchiladas, it came with beans and rice. The plate was set in front of me, and it was disgusting. The plate was messy. The beans and rice both had a hard crust on them. The beans had actually burst open from being under warming lights way too long. I contemplated calling over the server to complain, but I didn't want to cause a scene. So I tried two bites of the enchilada, and it was absolutely awful. I couldn't eat it, and pushed away my plate. I had two servers ask is I wanted a to go box, and I declined. I wasn't asked if there was something wrong. We payed the check, and left quietly. The more I thought about it, I decided to bring it to your attention.

I have a large family so going out to eat is rare and spending 100+ dollars on a meal is well thought out and a big deal for us. My husband and I chose Chili's as a special treat for our kids so it was a major bummer when the service was far below the standard. \n\nAll food was cold when it came out except my husband's steak and pictured is my Guacamole Burger (which is my favorite!) with sparse, brown guacamole because it sat out so long.""",,photo,https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10154030311153218&set=o.106027143213&type=3,2016-08-04 13:52:41,1,2,0

Unfortunately I have a bad memory with names but every time we have come here we have had him and he is the best waiter I've ever had. Being a former waitress I know how hard it is to keep every table u have happy and this guy goes out of his way to make sure that happens. \nIn the picture is a result of my youngest daughter gettin a hold of some mashed potatoes and loving them so much she decided her hair needed some too. When I asked for a rag to try to clean her up this wonderful boy got a brand new rag and came out and cleaned it up. My daughter adored it after she took her inspection of him in this picture lol. \nAfter speaking to the young man we had discovered he is trying to transfer to a restaurant down south. We did leave an outstanding review for him at the chico restaurant but I would really like to make it a point to get this boy recognized. He seems to be such a good hearted always smiling and hard working young man. I highly recommend transferring him and giving him a chance where ever he may go. I wish more people his age would work as hard as he does. Good luck man. Thank u so much for such a GREAT experience.\nUpdate: his name is Ryan Stanart""",,photo,https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=561150184071662&set=o.106027143213&type=3,2016-07-20 10:29:34,7,1,1

A guy, I'm guessing a manager (older man, gray/brown hair, glasses, dressed in all black) came over to say ''I hear you want a plain burger.''  I said a cheeseburger with only ketchup.  He goes on to tell me I basically want a plain burger & stood there debating whether it was plain or add ketchup. I shook my head in disgust as he walked away. My back was to him but my niece saw him roll his eyes & throw his hands up to gesture ''what's her problem''. I told my waiter to cancel the order & my sister, the kids and I left.

I asked if it still came with garlic bread and the employee said yes, and just stared at me. A second later she asked if I would like mine and I said, yes please. She went away and came back, saying that they were really busy and forgot to make it, so it would take another five to six minutes, and wanted to know if I still wanted the garlic bread. I said that I wouldn\'t have asked for it if I didn\'t want it, but I would have appreciated it if I didn\'t have to wait for it, while the rest of my food got cold. She said that she could get me a drink or chips and salsa for the order, which I declined, saying that I didn\'t really want a drink or salsa. She said she would get the manager, who came over and stated it would be another 1-2 minutes and stated that if I wanted to continue to wait, she would put my order under the heat lamp, yum yum. Or I could just leave without the garlic bread *implied. After waiting for approximately 6 minutes the order was ready and I left with my fresh garlic bread and heat lamped food. \n\nOnce home, I began to relate the story to my wife, complaining of the service or lack of it in this town and upon opening my order of Cajun pasta, immediately noticed what appeared to be a black hair wrapped around a piece of pasta. Disgusted, I used the supplied plastic fork and removed the hair and realized it wasn\'t a hair, but what actually appeared to be a cockroach antennae. I immediate got up and drove back to the restaurant and showed the wonderful addition to my food to the employee I originally dealt with, her eyes got big and she said she would have the manager ""fix"" this.  While there, my wife sent me a picture of her fried pickles, stating that I should also show them her order, as half the fried pickles was just the fried breading without pickles. The employee showed the manager the pasta with cockroach additives and the manager came over to me and said that she was sorry and could make my food again. I told her that I did not want to eat any food from her restaurant and showed her the picture my wife had just sent. She stated that she could make the order again or refund my money. I told her again that I did not want to eat any food from her restaurant and requested the refund. She asked how i paid, which was partially with a gift card and the rest on my credit card. She refunded the small amount to my credit card and then asked where the employee placed the gift card I used. The employee pointed to the trash. You guessed it. The manager dug through the trash and handed the gift card back to me saying that the total would be refunded back onto the card. Really??? Out of the trash???  No wonder you have pieces of insects in your food.  Thanks for the experience.'",,photo,https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10153577538848085&set=o.106027143213&type=3,2016-05-12 21:55:01,6,5,1

I was trying to push through my shift on Mother's Day so that I could get home to spend it with my mother. \nI was at the home stretch of my shift, when an annoyed customer came over and said that their table was dirty and requested another. So, as any employee would do, I directed them toward another table. But, that table was also dirty. On my way to get my manager, I slipped and fell once I entered the kitchen. The floor was COVERED in a slime made of mashed up food and water. I had recently ask one of the managers if the kitchen was even sanitary enough to be serving food, and he assured me that it was. \nDoes this look sanitary to you? I am honestly shocked that no one has had food poisoning. I accepted this job because I'm trying to pay car insurance and have some extra money for college. I need money, but I don't need it this bad. \nChili's is disgusting, and I advice everyone in York county to never eat at the chilis location on concord road. \nThey do not clean anything properly. I regret not leaving sooner. I'm glad I left while I had the chance. \nBe wary of where you eat. You never know what's going on behind closed doors.""",,photo,https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=632044686972025&set=o.106027143213&type=3,2016-05-08 21:00:01,3816,3195,8771

106027143213_10156854563210162,"b'So tonight we went to Chilis in Green Bay after Sapphira rocked the runway. It was the most awful service we have ever had there. Hostess had an attitude, waitress was slow and rude, our food came out separately, like 20 minutes for all food, Emily\'s food was burned, mine and my moms was cold, chicken was not cut properly (we had fajitas) and as you can see by the picture the portion was off, it\'s like someone ate half of it. Fajitas usually come to the table sizzling.. No sizzling just cold chicken, that we waited 20 minutes for after the first person was served their food. the manager said we were lying, and made excuses that because of Carrie Underwood they were busy and backed up. Was it busy? Yes- however I have been in there when it\'s even busier with a party of 20- all of our food was served together, the waitress came back several times, and everything was delicious. Tonight they had a total of seven servers- 4 in the bar, and 3 in the other area where we were seated. Not enough for a ""packed"" restaurant. Which the manager said they anticipated but didn\'t figure it out ahead of time. Chilis is my favorite restaurant and it was so disappointing this time. What put it over the top was instead of apologizing the manager wanted to fight with us, when we would not engage he said that we always seem to have problems and complaining about the food. (Not true- I\'ve actually written corporate three times with compliments) he even refused to give us his name. And all this above is just the tip of the ice berg. I can say that is the last time I am going to Chilis in Green Bay for a very long time! By the looks of the reviews on this page Chilis needs to get it together! Maybe go back to the basics of good service with a friendly face!'",,photo,https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10156854563210162&set=o.106027143213&type=3,2016-05-06 00:21:46,2,5,0

106027143213_10206056246941230,"b""The Chili's on 5005 Old Hickory Blvd, Hermitage, TN 37076 just gave us the WORST customer service I have ever experienced. My coworker and I decided to venture out of the office today and settled on Chili's. We sat ourselves in the bar area for faster service. From the time we sat down the service declined with each passing moment. It took about 10 minutes just to get a glass of water. Eventually after we flagged her down the server for the bar area made her way to take our order. We ordered from the 2 for 20 menu, the appetizer was decent but took forever to arrive. For our entr\xc3\xa9e I ordered the Bacon Cheeseburger with no cheese as I'm lactose intolerant. It is just easier to order the burger as is minus the cheese vs listing everything I want on a regular burger. Once my meal arrived, I began to prep my burger in the usual way, by removing the bun to add the condiments. The first things I noticed was there was NO bacon, or tomato. The second thing I noticed was evidence that they\xe2\x80\x99d added cheese and made the lack luster attempt to remove it after to fact. There were smaller strips of melted cheese on the burger and bun. Had I not removed the bun I would have consumed the burger cheese and all. This might not seem like a big deal but I am EXTREMELY sensitive to anything dairy and even the smallest amount can cause major digestive issues. When I alerted the waitress that there was an issue with the burger, she immediately offered to notify the manager for us to speak with.\n\nThe waitress returned after about 10 minutes and stated the Manager couldn\xe2\x80\x99t come out and he had given her his override card to comp the entr\xc3\xa9e portion of the meal and the next time we come to the restaurant the meal would be taken care of. However she never presented us with anything to support that this would happen. Since we paid for our beverages in cash the waitress took our case but never returned with a receipt. At this point we decided that we needed to contact the corporate office. I spoke with a representative who informed me that the general manager would reach out to us. The general manager did callback as promised. This experience was no better that what we had just endured at the restaurant. He was not empathetic and his response seemed almost scripted. He did not allow me to get many words in edgewise, he spoke over me and then ended the call abruptly by saying he would call the restaurant to find out what happened. This is unacceptable on all accounts. I will NEVER eat at another Chili\xe2\x80\x99s as this was not the first bad experience. This was in fact the second experience were I received poor customer service.""",,photo,https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10206056246941230&set=o.106027143213&type=3,2016-04-01 14:46:21,8,9,1

We did not want to complain about the small portion of the salmon because we did not want to ruin our time there. The TX cheese fries were so delicious because you place enough topping on top of it. Your desser berry cake was delicious but you need to do without the blackberries because the seeds got in our teeth. Overall, we did come back a few days later, which was today but I need to locate my recipe to give you the survery. The young boy was a supervisor and very mannerly. Our service was excellent.

When we got our bill, we were shocked to find a charge of $1.99 for ""games."" We have been to CHii\'s restaurants plenty of times and have used the little kiosk at the table at least 3-4 times. NEVER told there was a charge for playing the fun games (we love Trivia) while waiting for food to come. NEVER charged before, I think (now I don\'t know).\nUgh! NEVER informed of a charge on screen prior to starting Trivia game. We told our waiter Derek (awesome) and he apologized several times. He had already taken this issue to management before and will do so again tonight. Derek offered that what makes this issue worse is that some Chili\'s establishments charge, some don\'t; some table kiosks inform you prior to start of any games, some do not!!!! If we hadn\'t already paid our bill he would have removed it. It\'s not the $1.99 price tag, but it\'s something they attach to your bill without your knowledge, and it\'s deceptive and just plain WRONG!! Those devices were installed initially to order at your table so they could hire less workers. Now they keep them there to entertain you, allow you to order another round of drinks direct to the bar, and then charge you for it.\nBeware of the $2 upcharge whenever you go to CHili\'s ANYWHERE in the world and touch the table kiosk!'",,photo,https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10206726044162711&set=o.106027143213&type=3,2015-10-14 22:02:44,0,0,0

During my visit today I ordered chicken fajitas when my order arrived it had two tortillas (really only two for all that chicken??)... I quickly ran out and waited a while for the bartender to actually be at the bar for a moment so that I could ask for more. Then I waited 15 minutes more, the bartender came back and asked if I was okay, I reminded the bartender who said someone must have forgotten to bring them out. So I finally get my extra tortillas (three this time) they were clearly once warmed but weren't so much anymore and my food on my plate had long lost that fajitas sizzle everyone enjoys so much and was instead semi-cold at this point as well. I love Chili's, I stop in at a lot of locations when on the road for work.

He went in today to work his shift and they had his shift covered. In two years he has called off maybe three times due to a surgery he had and two that our son had. He\xe2\x80\x99s never late and he goes in when others call off or when it\xe2\x80\x99s asked of him. Apparently hate speech is allowed and even defended there\xe2\x80\xa6 I would not call that place \xe2\x80\x98family friendly.\xe2\x80\x99 This is disrespectful to not only my family but everyone who knows someone with Down syndrome or has Down syndrome themselves!

You can use these things to pay your bill, play games or to notify the server you need something; the servers said they are supposed to encourage customers to use them. Tonight was my first experience with this device and everything seemed okay, at first. I swiped my debit card to pay for the check and began using the handy tip calculator.  As you slide your finger the tip amount increases and automatically adjusts your total. Pretty cool huh?...Until you check the math on the tip percentage. It was off by about $1.75. I brought it to the manager\'s attention and he took a picture with his phone and told me he would advise the corporate office. I\'m not sure if it needs a software update or a redesign, but THIS is definitely messed up.  The picture speaks for itself...By the way, the overage multiplied by an estimate of 200 checks per day comes out to $350, or around $10,000 per month, or about $100,000 per year...And that\'s just one of 1,279 stores nationwide.

It seems that the chilies on Denton highway has to make every mistake every single time that they did not make previously. Well done means no pink all the way through. No ketchup, tomatoes, and onions. mustard only with lettuce and pickles means just that. Every time I order I get a rare hamburger with mustard and mayonnaise and they decide to put whatever other side they want on there. And we been there I'd say a total of about 10+ times in the past two months. Since our info is saved from every time we have previously ordered and the fact that we had to pull the manager aside to let him know his cooks and waitresses and waiters and the people on the phone do not know what they are doing. You'd think they'd at least treat someone, who has previously caused problems for that store because we've had to pull the manager aside, with importance. And that's just my order a simple bacon burger with mustard pickles and lettuce only. Two of the 10+ times the fries were nice warm and fresh every other time they were dry crusted and under the heat lamp for at least three hours. I know this because I used to work in a fast food industry. heat lamps are not good for keeping things warm they're only good for dehydrating all the items. #Chilisdentonhywy .

106027143213_10205462473663687,"b""I can tell you a story... I am super upset, annoyed, frustrated and irritated. Tonight my family of 6 decided to go to chili's for dinner, only to wait 40 minutes. I get waiting. It happens. However let me tell you about my complete experience. Our waitress Jessica (Orlando, Florida Mall location) was phenomenal! She had superb customer service. Jessica anticipated our requests before we even could have thought about what we may have needed, kept us smiling and the family laughing. If my customer experience was based solely on Jessica, I probably would not even be taking to Facebook. Unfortunately my customer experience is not based on just my waitress it is based on how the food tastes, smells and is presented. My experience also includes how clean the environment is and this is where my trip for dinner gets horrible. \n\nI get my drink. A cold class of pop only to discover that there is lettuce on the side of my cup. (As my husband said later: this should have given us a clue!) I grab a chip and some salsa, as everyone does right! Well I drip some on my shirt. Having no extra napkins on my table I ask my husband to give me one of the 6 rolled up fork and knife sets on the table. I open the first one, there is water spots. Not really a huge deal. BUT!!!! I flip it over and have a few pieces of someone else's dinner on my fork. I ask him to hand me another one (2nd set) open it only to find more food on the fork. I throw it down and ask again for another set (3rd). I proceed to open it and guess what!!!! The napkin was used previously!!!! How gross!!! Now upset I ask for another set (4th)... Yep you guessed it my knife had dried prices of napkin stick to it. Along with someone else's food (more food!!!!!) I am pissed at the moment, but still need to wipe off my shirt. So I again ask my husband for another set (5th). He hands it to me and I open it..... Five! Five sets I had to go trough only to locate ANOTHER SET of dirty, gross and disgusting food on the fork and knife. The knife was so caked with food, that had obviously been washed since it was rock hard that I thought I order a small brownish-black cake!!!!!!!!\n\nI get up and go to the hostess, show her my pile or collection of knifes and forks an request to speak to the manager. She tries to take the sets from me. Yes take them. I pull away and was like no I'll keep these. \n\nI talk with the first manager. This is how it goes. Oh my that is gross. We were short handed this afternoon and someone roll the forks who doesn't normally do it. Really so your telling me that no one saw this???? I find that hard to believe she proceeds to tell me that she will take them and speak to her other manager. Again she tries to take them just like the the previous person. \n\nThe next manger comes out.. I show her and tell her my experience with the disgusting forks and knifes. She says oh yes that is unacceptable. These should have never been rolled. She continues with telling me that they were short staffed and they had a SERVER roll these earlier today!!! So basically your telling me that a SEVER rolled these. That makes my experience so much better!!!!! She then tells me that she will take care of my meal and get me new forks and knives from the back. I said thank you and no thanks to the fork and knife. \n\nI educated my server on the situation as I completely bypassed her originally. She says oh my goodness that horrible and should have never made it to the floor. She leaves and comes back with our food. I at this time was not sure if I was going to eat. She asks and brings me plastic ware to eat. (Which I could only eat a few bites as I was at this point sick to my stomach) she also tells me that the manager said she was taking care of our meal. I was satisfied for the most part and dealing with the situation. \n\nAt a later part of the dinner I stepped out and again my husband was told the meal would be taken care of. \n\nAt the end of our meal we were asked if we wanted desert by Jessica. She said the manager said it was on her. Cheesecake was our pick, yummy! After Jessica leaves the manager comes back to the table and says I wanted to give you something sweet to finish your night here and hands me a bill. She explains that she took off   50% and the rest we are responsible for. I guess I heard wrong when I was told our meals would be taken care of. To make it even better after Jessica brings us our dessert and says her goodbyes, I raise the bill and an electronic gift card to pay for it and I receive a dumbfounded face from her. She walks over and I hand her the bill and my gift card she says oh I thought she said your meal was taken care of. I took my apron off so I have to find a pen. \n\nSo now I paid $20 for a $40 meal that I thought was going to be taken care of. \n\nHow would you rate this experience? Well let's just say that chili's USED to be my favorite restaurant!!!! Now I am not even sure if I want to go back. Knowing the background of who rolled my utensils and how they even thought it was a okay to continue rolling them to give to customers... \n\nThanks for reading!

Needless to say cold would be an understatement at this point where the integrity of the overall consistency is lacking.  Should I have worn dentures I may like my crispers to be similar to the mashed potatos but unfortunately for Gosford Bakersfield I have a full set of natural teeth.  They took away my purple steak before I could get a picture however this was not the first purple steak of the night.  A table not far also had this situation.  My favorite was when the manager argued with my husband that it wasn't an hour it was in fact 54min exactly from which the order was taken to the time it hit the table.  We are very understanding people and should he apologized and taken responsibility for the actions of this location we would have not been upset.  We did not eat one bite but still paid for drinks... Which might I add were jot refilled with in this 54min time.  I would also like to state there was no wait... This was not a busy time and they did not appear in anyway to be short staffed.  I do not care to hear your excuses as to why you waisted out date night together or why I am now eating fast food as all the other options have closed.  I paid my bill and was blamed for this terrible experience after my 10 hour work day.  We just wanted a nice night together and you have taken that and replaced it with a far bitter taste that will linger indefinitely.  Please excuse any grammatical errors as I am beyond frustrated and tired I am sure you get the gist of my protest.  This is Earl O'Dell's wife my phone died while waiting for dinner...

Luckily there was a never ending flow of chips & salsa plus tablets to keep them busy.\n\nAfter our food arrived I went to find the manager. I showed him my Facebook status that had been posted when we were originally being seated and told him that ""our food has just been served, which is great, but I\'d like to know why it\'s taken 47 minutes."" He apologized and said ""I\'ll take some of your food off the bill"".

I was impressed at how quick the social media department got back to me. Yet, I was then disappointed to read they gad just given a generic apology and the company email. I actually took the time to email the address given and never heard back until today. As I came back to this page to find my original post I cannot find it therefore I am having to write another one. My only thoughts are I missed it scrolling through or it was deleted as so many people stated they wouldn't take their family back here after seeing the picture. Therefore, I am placing the picture of the chicken again along with the email sent today.

106027143213_10152574769946215,"b""So I took my wife and niece to our local Chili's today for lunch and had a pretty sad experience. Service was poor but I can't necessary put that on the waitress because she was working the whole bar area alone. It took a while to get  3 sodas and the food took over 30 minutes to show up (pretty sure speed of service goals for a casual dining restaurant is in the 12-15 minute range). I shared my disappointment with the speed of the kitchen and the waitress was very nice but said they only have 1 guy working back there this time of day. Apparently saving on labor is more important than guest service and satisfaction. That said, I can appreciate the need to balance labor to half hour sales but call in help if you need it. When the food arrives it's lukewarm at best and the limes on top of our Margarita Chicken (see pic) has clearly not been stored or held according to food safety standards. Once I saw how slow things were running and how old the limes were my concerns around other short cuts became even greater so I think it's important for your guests to know their health may be at risk visiting this location. The waitress never asked how everything was to likely avoid an unpleasant answer. I never saw the manager so who knows where they were. \n\nWe've had issues here in the past but it just seems to happen over and over again. I've shared feedback verbally in the restaurant, on the survey machine at the table, and through the online survey with seemingly no improvement so I thought I would try your Facebook page. I know you can just remove the post and pretend the issue doesn't exist but that won't make it better. Chances are many people have experienced the same thing here and just haven't said anything which means you can't address the issue. \n\nI'm not looking for a free meal, just a better experience for the next person that walks through the door. The new signs and decor look great but the poor guest experience is going to make all the upgrades pointless.""",,photo,https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10152574769946215&set=o.106027143213&type=3,2014-07-30 15:41:46,8,10,0

We were looking forward to an enjoyable meal in your restaurant as I will be away for some times with my family however what has happened was utterly disgusted.  During our meals, we have been attended by a very rude and unprofessional Outlet Manager named Rosie.\n\nFirst of all, we are a group of 5 with my mum which she is a vegan.  After looking at the menu, we found out that your restaurant does not cater any vegetarian/vegan dishes.  As the waiter approached us to take our order, we enquired if the kitchen could make us a salad for my mum, and he answered 'NO' as all they can offer is within the menu.  So that's fine for us, we still remain to dine in.  However, as for my mum, we have to look around to get her dinner and bring it in your restaurant (not knowing a signage of NO OUTSIDE FOOD).  \n\nWhile all of us having our meals, Rosie approached our table requesting my mum to take away her food as she explained NO OUTSIDE FOOD ALLOW.  Then I explained to her that my mum is a vegan and that there's nothing that you can offered.  And she replied, though you can't have your food here and please keep it away.  I felt shocked with her answer and asked if my mum could just finish her meal and refused rudely by Rosie claiming that if she has not seen her eating that's fine.  We have never been to any restaurant that has such a poor customer service that cannot even try to be understanding and accommodate a customer for this reason.\n\nThis has ruined our entire dinner and we had to quit our dinner and asked for the bill.  Then we had to asked someone in charged to deal with our matter.  The restaurant manager came to us and apologised but why not the Outlet Manager who has fault at first and also who is the senior person during the operation.\n\nNot to mention, your food quality's is not up to a standard of a global steakhouse chain restaurant (please refer to attached photos).""",,photo,https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10203260170159478&set=o.106027143213&type=3,2014-07-18 12:09:43,1,3,0

I have been going there for several years and have been disappointed the last couple of trips. This location is the most poorly managed restaurant I have ever been too and the sad thing is it never used to be this way. \n\nToday like the last two times I dined there we arrived to a 20-25 minute wait with less than half the restaurant full (see attached pictures). I watched two groups walk out while we waited. One large party and party of three. \n\nMorale among staff seems extremely low and I am willing to guess there is high turnover. While our waitress Lisa was great and extremely nice she was extremely over worked and often busy. The whole staff there just seems like they need a little leadership. I mentioned the poor management to two employees and both of there responses were \xe2\x80\x9cI agree\xe2\x80\x9d. You would think if I complained to two employees a manager or supervisor would come over but no such luck.\n\nI was give the business card of General Manager Richard Jean. I strongly recommend that someone from your corporate office at Mr. Jean's management or this location will not succeed. This is the first time I have ever complained about a restaurant to their corporate office but this is a true disappoint of a once great location.""",,photo,https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10100261880840670&set=o.106027143213&type=3,2014-07-03 20:05:07,0,3,0

Even when I order to go from here it's an issue. I'm not a picky person. I have truly given up on having excellent customer service when I come to these type of establishments because I know that employment here is a heavily revolving door and it's just not cost effective to take the time to train your hostesses and servers on what service with a smile means. I'm usually good with being seated and having my order brought to me in a timely manner and how it's described on the menu. However this Chili's can't even do that. Upon entering this particular Chili's the hostess directed us to sit in the bar area. I asked to sit on the opposite side because of my previous experience from sitting in the bar area with one particular server. However the hostess obviously had a problem with that because she rolled her eyes at my request! My sever came over and took our orders. I order the lunch combo with the house salad and California Club (which is pictured below) I received the sandwich and about five minutes later they brought the salad. The menu describes the sandwich as being served on wheat Texas toast. When I asked I was told they didn't have anymore Texas toast. At no point did anyone ask me if I wanted something else or informed me there wasn't anymore Texas toast. I really couldn't care any less about the food but having to endure poor customer service because of poor management has gone long enough.

Our table of 6 waited at Chili's for over 40 mins to celebrate Father's Day with my dad and husband. During our wait we watched table after table be seated before us. We saw approximately 8 dirty tables and a full bar not being cleaned. We then saw a waiter drop this on the floor and no one clean it for over 20 mins. When we asked how long until we are seated, the waiter rudely said to the hostess, 'oh, this lovely table' and pointed to us. She laughed and replied, 'yes.' She looked at us with a smirk and asked if we still wanted a highchair for our 2-yr-old. I said, 'no, I want to see a manager.' She laughed and went to clean a table. She returned and said the table was ready do I still want a highchair. Again, I demanded to see a manager. She rolled her eyes and returned with him. I explained to him that I specialize in customer service and was disgusted with the treatment we were receiving from his staff and by the horrible state of the restaurant. He claims that he trained them well but I spent 30+ mins listening to his staff chitchat about their boy problems and pretend to clean rather than flip tables and welcome guests. He apologized but we could tell he didn't realize that he was loosing a large ticket and tip for a holiday celebration. He looked scared rather than concerned by our complaints.

That's not an issue, but for the amount, and charging extra, it's ridiculous.  Glad to see that you're finally doing tableside guacamole.  I have had the lunch fajitas before, and I had almost the same amount of meat with this full sized order!

After paying over $50 for the fajita platter we had to cook the steak we paid for some more because the inside was still raw, shiny, gummy, and more red than rare meat should be. This does not live up to health code standards. We may be receiving a $20 gift certificate but why would we want to spend it at Chili's in Plainview if they either continuously burn or not even cook the meat? Also the manager rudely commented that we should specify to the cook at which temperature we would like our meat prepared. We just want it cooked to where it is edible! Disgusting.

She loves avocados and when I gave her the menu with the options she immediately choose this. I figured she would and I was interested to try it too. Unfortunately the bottom picture is what we received. Note the lack of full avocado slices and large chicken chunks pictured in the top picture which was what was in your menu. I asked the waitress to please bring me some more avocado for my daughter, as the picture shows slices, and more than one, and clearly we got one slice at best chopped up into small pieces. Which she kindly did. But then she charged me for it!!! When, in my opinion it should have been includedin the price of what I had already gotten because I purchased what was in the top picture. This is something you guys should review. If you're only going to give one slice of avocado cut up into tiny chunks, don't advertise several full slices of avocado then charge customers extra when they ask for what was pictured in the menu. My daughter really wanted the avocados. She's too young to understand false advertisement.

106027143213_10201151062812670,"b""I just wanted to share my most recent experience at a Chili's, in El Paso, Texas. I don't eat at Chili's very often, but decided to take the family out there for dinner, at their bidding. I've only been to this particular one once, to enjoy drinks at the bar. After watching a roach crawl across the bar top, I didn't return for years. But convinced by my family to give it another shot, combined with a positive food experience at a chilis on another side of town, I gave in. \n\nRed flags came up immediately, when someone dropped off our appetizers and a stack of small, wet plates. The server immediately looked down, and noticed food still on one, then proceeded to snatch it up and return it to the kitchen. Then, returning with a supposedly clean replacement. (Picture below.) Obviously the plates were just rinsed, and not even thoroughly, as they had food residue clearly visible, and still wet, on the plates. My husband asked me not to make a big deal of it, so as to not startle the kids. So we ate the fried cheese without the plates. After a few bites, nobody wanted theirs, though, because instead of being stringy, flavorful cheese, they were mushy, and wet. (Like the consistency of mashed potatoes.) I'm not even sure how they managed to screw up cheese sticks, but they did. Moving on. My son's entree arrived, which was a corn dog and fries. He was very disappointed to find that it only came with literally 5 French fries. Not a great deal for the $4.99 price tag, if you ask me. I should've taken a picture, but he'd already started eating them before I could. To make matters worse, and I mean MUCH worse, upon taking my daughter to the restroom, we entered the bathroom to hear someone vomiting. I opened the stall door, just in time to witness a female staff member walking out of the restroom, after having vomited, without washing her hands. I was absolutely disgusted to know that this person was handling food/dishe. Because of that, I wasn't very shocked when my son and I both got sick from our meals that night (although, thankfully, my husband and daughter didn't.) I am appalled at the practices taking place at this locale, and will be spreading the word. I will absolutely not be frequenting this facility anymore, and will recommend that others stay away as well.""",,photo,https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10201151062812670&set=o.106027143213&type=3,2014-02-25 20:43:23,0,6,0

I just want the Chili\'s people to know how AWESOME they are!! <3\r\n\r\nCarrie Pringle with Lo Jones and Cameron Pringle\r\n\r\nYesterday we took BrynLeigh to dinner at Chilis in Riverdale.\r\nWe had a waiter who seemed very frustrated with BrynLeigh, and B caught on very quickly. We weren\'t asked if we wanted appetizers, and when he was taking our drink orders, we felt rushed. BrynLeigh asked if they had Cream Soda, and got a firm ""No""..and settled on a Diet Coke after about 3 minutes of deciding.\r\n\r\nWhen he came back for food orders, he said, ""Ready to order yet?""....we were ready, but BrynLeigh was still looking at her kids menu. She had to circle the one she wanted, and the waiter grew more and more impatient. He rested his arm on a ledge, looked up, looked down. ""Hurry"" was written all over his face, and BrynLeigh knew she wasn\'t going fast enough. She finally whispered to her mom ""Cheeseburger"".\r\nThe waiter didn\'t say a word, instead, he grabbed our orders, and walked off. A waitress who was on her way to another table, came by and asked how our visit was going. I said, ""Actually horrible."" She kneeled down, and asked us what was going on. I explained the waiters frustrations with BrynLeigh, and she felt terrible. I then explained BrynLeigh is Autistic, and is very thorough. She needs to read all of her options, and takes a while to make decisions. Not just with food.\r\nShe immediately went to find the store manager, and we explained again, and she said ""I\'ll get the situation handled.""\r\nThe waitress came back and asked BrynLeigh if she would like anything else while waiting for her food, and let us know the original waiter we had, was just let go. The manager came back, and let us know, Chili\'s does NOT put up with the customer service (or lack thereof) that we had with the waiter.\r\nBrynLeigh was so happy with our new waitress, and thought she was gorgeous. lol They were so kind, and completely turned our horrible date night, into a night we would never forget. We are so grateful.\r\nOn our way back to the car, we ended up going back inside, so BrynLeigh could get a picture with her new friend, Sterling.\r\n\r\nI am writing this today, because I want everyone to remember, that no matter where you work, shop, live, you are going to eventually run into someone who is special needs. BrynLeigh has recently become really sensitive and shy around people, because she has been treated differently so many times. It\'s like she\'s protecting herself sometimes. I know she will run into people like this waiter, for the rest of her life, and as long as we are there, she will be protected. But we can\'t always be with her. So please, be patient. Children (and adults) need your patience, and understanding more than anything. Be friendly. And don\'t rush them. Even after he was aware of her Autism, there was no apology from him, instead he just stared from a distance, and avoided our table. Except to throw some napkins down. Anytime he passed our table, BrynLeigh ducked behind her mom.\r\nWe are so grateful for Sterling, and the store manager. I hope they know how much it meant to us, and to BrynLeigh that our visit was turned around for Bryn.'",,photo,https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10151663843971570&set=o.106027143213&type=3,2013-10-23 16:13:42,19,10,3

I don't think I will ever eat at Chili's again after the past couple of experiences I have had. I most definitely will never order sweet tea again after looking over and seeing one of the cleaning rags down in one of the pitchers of sweet tea that were being used to give refills. This is a major health violation in my opinion and a great way to lose customers. I would have never noticed it if my tea didn't taste so funny and I didn't see one of the servers cleaning a table and then putting the rags and cleaning spray back in the caddy next to where the sweet tea pitchers were. I also didn't like the fact that our server made it sound like some of the things we got were optional and then charged us for them without telling us that they cost extra or how much extra they were.

Last night we went for carry out to the Mitchell Ranch location and the food was horrible again. When my roommate got there he noticed the chicken was black and asked to have the order remade and then got an attitude from the manger Joe Elefante who said he would remake the order fresh. The 2nd time the order came out the rice was in a plastic bag with rotten cilantro and the Texas cheese fries burned. Come on guys I expect a lot more from your brand. Honestly if the Manager nor the cook can do the job maybe you need to replace them.

My daughter was visably tearing up. We had a very sweet server named Chelsea. She was like heaven sent, very empathetic and very attentive. She obviously sensed we needed a moment and made sure not to intrude in our discussions. She was so kind and patient. She defintely enjoyed her job and you could see it with every expressions she made.  We decided to split and entree\' and order dessert. As she brought our dessert, she mentioned this to us that when her family has dessert, that they must say two things they are thankful for first. She started it off and said she was thankful for having the opportunity to have a great job, and also said she was grateful for such a beautiful day. Then my daughter said what she was thankful for. It made my day to hear my daughter say she was thankful to have me in her life, considering my cheesy thankful remark was, that I was thankful for the delicious dessert. I was very pleased with my experience and Chelsea brightened our day. I left her a tip to express my thanks, and left a card that said ""No act of kindness, no matter how small is ever wasted."" -Aeso ""Paying if forward one day at a time"".\r\nWhat\'s ironic... is that this transaction never debited my account, inquiring minds wonder.

I'm glad that they made up for this, but then again, Chili's are willing to fix food orders. They have a major problem working with people who get hurt on their property. I badly cut my finger on a staple that was sticking up in one of their menues. It literally ripped layers of skin off my thumb. The remainder of our meal, we were avoided like the plague. The table behind us complained about their appetizers being skimpy and their drinks not having enough alcohol, and they got the royal treatment for the remainder of the evening. All I got was a bandage for my bleeding finger which I had to ask for myself. I would have appreciated an apology, but I never got one from the manager. We did not get refills on our drinks, nor did they come and ask us if everything was ok. I sat and watched as the manager went from table to table, talking to everyone but our party of three. I emailed Chili's headquarters. They asked me to send information about my experience. I sent everything they asked for, but that is where it ended. I have not heard from them since, except the occasions I posted a picture of the skin hanging from my thumb on their Facebook page. CHILI'S IS A BIG JOKE!!! I think I will repost that picture on their page again tonight.""",,photo,https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=617238004958544&set=o.106027143213&type=3,2013-03-25 23:18:17,2,71,0

106027143213_4767574347510,"b'I want to share the experience that my husband, 7 year old autistic sister and I had today at the Chili\xe2\x80\x99s location in Midvale, UT.  Arianna, my little sister, didn\xe2\x80\x99t waste any time when our waitress, Lauren, greeted us at our table.  Arianna promptly ordered her cheeseburger with pickles, french fries, and chocolate milk before Lauren could even take our drink order.  Lauren smiled and told Arianna, \xe2\x80\x9cOkay! I\xe2\x80\x99ll be right back with your chocolate milk!\xe2\x80\x9d.  When we got our food I was wondering why Arianna wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t touch her cheeseburger, but was going to town on her french fries. I asked her, \xe2\x80\x9cArianna are you going to eat your cheeseburger?\xe2\x80\x9d She calmly said, \xe2\x80\x9cNo, I don\xe2\x80\x99t want it.\xe2\x80\x9d Cheeseburgers, or \xe2\x80\x98Krabby Patties\xe2\x80\x99 as we sometimes call them, are her FAVORITE! So this behavior was VERY strange. So I asked her, \xe2\x80\x9cWhy don\xe2\x80\x99t you want it?\xe2\x80\x9d.  She replied, \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s broken. I need another one thats fixed.\xe2\x80\x9d  Then it dawned on me why she wasn\xe2\x80\x99t eating it.  It\xe2\x80\x99s because it was cut in half. Being a child with autism, she has to have certain things in a particular order at all times.  One slight change in her routine can change the course of the day instantly.  When Lauren came back to check on us, I asked if we could order another cheeseburger and just add it to our check.  She had a concerned look on her face so I explained that Arianna has autism, and that in her mind, because the cheeseburger was cut in half, she thinks its broken and can\xe2\x80\x99t eat it. I told Lauren I knew it sounded silly, but if we could just order an additional one we will gladly pay for it because there was nothing wrong with the one that was originally brought out. Lauren was so sweet and just smiled and went along with Arianna, telling her \xe2\x80\x9cI brought you a broken cheeseburger?! You know what, I\xe2\x80\x99ll have them cook you a new one!\xe2\x80\x9d I loved this because rather than just taking it from the table, she actually TOLD Arianna what she was doing.  While this seems insignificant, by her telling Arianna what she was doing, we avoided a melt down.  The manager, Bradley Cottermole, then came to our table, kneeled down, and said to Arianna, \xe2\x80\x9cI heard we gave you a broken cheeseburger!  I am so sorry about that! We are making you a brand new one that isn\xe2\x80\x99t broken, with pickles! I\xe2\x80\x99ll bring you some french fries to munch on while you\xe2\x80\x99re waiting, ok?\xe2\x80\x9d A couple of minutes later, Lauren arrived back at our table with cheeseburger #2.  Arianna said, \xe2\x80\x9cOH FANK YOU! You fixded my cheeseburger!\xe2\x80\x9d When Lauren walked away, Arianna just sat there for a second and looked at her new burger.  She looked like so deep in thought....just staring at it....then she let out a big \xe2\x80\x9dOH I missed you!!\xe2\x80\x9d and started kissing the burger over and over again. I showed Lauren this picture and said, \xe2\x80\x9cI think we glorified the cheeseburger too much!\xe2\x80\x9d She busted up laughing, and asked if she could go show her manager.  She came back a minute later and said she showed everyone in the back kitchen area too, and that it made them all laugh and smile.  I was so touched by this experience.  Especially since I know people who have been asked to leave restaurants when their child with autism is being disruptive.  I expected a few different things with this scenario based on past experiences, but I did NOT expect such kind and compassionate mannerisms from Lauren and Bradley.  Everyone, from the hostess to the chef, played a role in what most people would think isn\xe2\x80\x99t a big deal.  But this entirely shaped how the rest of our day would go.  I know...a cheeseburger cut in half literally could make or break our day.  In this case thanks to the professionalism of the crew in Midvale, it made our day.  And I\xe2\x80\x99m sure Arianna brightened up at least one of the employees days with her silly little personality.  Thank you.'",,photo,https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=4767574347510&set=o.106027143213&type=3,2013-03-24 21:45:27,873168,50379,207140

My husband had Mayo on his burger (which mind you my husband didn\'t say anything about it because our other Chili\'s location would always ask if you wanted that on there so he didn\'t even think to mention he was allergic) When my husband said ""oh no, it has mayo on it"" our server gave an ""I\'m not sending it back attitude"" until I spoke up and informed him it was due to allergies not preference, then he finally sent it back. I also had food crusted onto my plate (I have a picture) again my husband told me to ignore it since it wasn\'t touching my food and it was on the rim. His burger came back and my drink was empty and staid empty for 20 minutes, he dropped my second lemonade of the night off with the check.... I took one sip of it before seeing ANOTHER HUGE DRIED ON SAUCE SMUDGE on the side of my glass (also took pictures) This time I could not ignore it since it turned my stomach!!!!! After another 10 minutes of waiting for the check to be picked up so I could leave,  I called out to one Manager I saw (Spanish Male) and was ignored twice before getting Emily\'s attention (got her name from my receipt) I showed her my glass, plate, told her about the menu and also the other lady that requested clean spoons for the third time, she said she was sorry and took our check, she told another server to go get Randall and she spoke to him about 4 feet from our table at the server station, Randall passed us two other times and never said a word to us to apologize for the service or the crusty food all over my glass or plate.

This is extremely unacceptable. And both times we threw a royal fit and they refused to opt the entire meal. They made us pay for my meal, our drinks and appetizer. Management ( the Manager's name is Robin Howe) there is also very rude....extremely rude and needs to learn customer satisfaction.

In the hour that we were there, we had to ASK for refills, had three different servers, had two orders wrong, had another order go missing (mine, which means I didn't eat), and didn't even get our orders until the last 15 minutes (so those that got their meals had to rush).  On top of that, the manager was only marginally apologetic.  So, I spoke with the general manager and he covered our meals.

I talke with the waitress and she informed me that Chilis no longer flame grills and all ""grilled"" meat is cooked on the flat top.  With this being true I will no longer be ordering steak or chicken at your establishments. And it will be difficult to dine with Chilis at all because those were the items I liked.

We were seated immediately by one of two hostess\xe2\x80\x99. We waited for over an hour for our food before we finally got fed up and left (our food never showed). During our wait, our server and a \xe2\x80\x9cmanager\xe2\x80\x9d stopped by our table a few times to apologize for the wait. The last time the \xe2\x80\x9cmanager\xe2\x80\x9d stopped by, she said she was going to offer us 1 brownie for our inconvenience. I found out later that this was not even an act of kindness on her part but in fact the deal of the day offered to anyone that accepted it. About 25 minutes after the last apology, our food still had not arrived and we left. After leaving the location, I called the restaurant and asked to speak to a manager. I was put on hold for almost 5 minutes and I hung up and called back. When I asked for a manager, the gentleman that answered informed me that he was the manager. I explained my situation and he told me he had just been informed of what had happened. I asked him why our food never showed up. He explained that the server never actually submitted our order and it had in fact only been submitted AFTER we had left. I got the home office number and plan on calling them Monday.

Today, for the first time I spoke with the manager who will be on duty for the party night and right away, without hesitation he said nope we don't normally do reservations ... but for the guys who are deploying, we are going to make an exception this time and make this happen so you don't need to worry about the reservation, your tables WILL be ready at 7:00. Also we don't normally give a military discount but we are gonna do one tomorrow night for the guys to show our appreciation. WOWWWWWW !

I normally go during the week being 7+ mths pregnant I crave Chili's. We normally go to Chili's in Cartersville, GA (they are the greatest). This time was different; way different and it did change my perspective on the way they treated my family and I. We got to Chili's in Rome, GA and we had a party of 6. We sat down because we had 2 children and we waited on the rest of the party to get there. This was at 6:07 p.m. I used the restroom with my daughter and came back. My husband had ordered our waters. Within 5 minutes our server Mike brought out the waters. Around 6:15; We then proceeded to order the queso dip with chips and salsa. He said I will get this order in and bring it back to you. Our company arrived with one extra person. Not a problem since we were sitting at a big table. Our guest arrived at 6:40 pm. (traffic bad cause of an accident is why they were late) (Not one time in 25 minutes did our server stop and ask if we were okay or did he refill my husbands water.) We still did not have our queso dip with 2 small children hungry and me 7+ mths pregnant hungry. Well then our guests ordered there sweet tea and asked for appetizers. I then asked our server did he forget about our appetizer. He then said the kitchen was behind. Not even 5 minutes later our guest had their appetizers and then the server brought out ours. (no later than 6:50 pm)  He then got our our orders. 7 people. Split tickets. Not too hard. So at least our children had something to munch on and eat. Within this time 3 other groups sat in the same area with our server. They were served drinks and appetizers in a timely manner. The 3 groups then got their food before we did. By this time our guest were wondering what is going on, besides my husband and I. We looked and it was 7:24 p.m  (34 minutes since we placed the order) it finally came out around 7:30. During this time. They forgot to bring out our guest his fajitas trio. So we all sat around waiting (except the children) on our guest to get his food. 7:40 p.m. our guest received his food. So by the time we all started eating our food (4 adults) were cold. So we got done about within 10 minutes. Since we sat there almost 1 hr before we received our food. Remember we place the order at 6:50 p.m. We asked for our tickets 2 times before the waiter brought the food and after he did. During this time our guest had already refilled their sweet tea 2 times since the server seemed to think we were invisible. So at 8:00 p.m. we got our ticket and our guest didnt want to take there food home since it took us forever to get it. I then asked the guest why our amount was 21.94 that he already included tip. which brought it to 25.14. I asked the server how come the tip was included. He said you have a big party so we automatically include it. I said on your menus it says a party of 8+ gets gratuity included. I said we have 7 and its also split ticket. I said this was one of the worst services we have ever had so I dont want you getting the tip that is written I will leave the amount you deserve. No one else in our party was going to say something but I do not feel that he had a right to treat us that way. He then said this is ridiculous I cant control the kitchen staff and how they cook the food. He them stormed off with our ticket. This time the other guest we had went and paid their ticket 57.00 and some change while I was waiting for our ticket. I told my husband to take the kids to the car while I waited. About 8:10 ish the manager came over and was like let me take care of the bill. I told him its not a problem we can pay for our food. I just did not appreciate the server. I then told him about the 1 hr and 53 min and told him everything I just written down. Then another server came up and said you dont know his situation but his mother just had a stroke and he has to deal with people like you. The manager did not say anything to her but then I said you dont bring your personal life to work. I can make excuses all day about me being pregnant but I have not. Then she rolled her eyes and stormed off. I am in Culinary School and have taken the hospitality classes and server classes. I have also worked as a waitress for 4 years. I do know how it feels but you can not bring your personal life to work. Paying customers should not have been treated that way. So then we paid for our food and left. I will NOT go eat at Chili's in Rome GA again. We will drive to Cartersville Ga to eat Chili's and this means that the Rome store may not suffer much but I eat there 2 times a week during lunch and they have just lost my business. By the way our server his name was Mike. """,,status,,2012-11-14 07:12:23,2,2,0

Last night we went to eat at our local Chili\'s, as we were walking in there was a family of 5 getting ready to be seated and one older gentleman, I would say in his late 80\'s early 90\'s.  The manager said something to this older gentleman and he turned and walked back outside.  The family in front of us looked stunned.  Then I heard one of them say, ""He\'s a Veteran!"" One of the younger gentlemen in the party of 5 went back outside, asked the older gentleman to come back in.  When they were back inside the younger gentleman told the hostess, ""Seat this gentleman and send his bill to our table!""  I was stunned!  The manager of the restaurant actually refused this American Hero his Veterans Dinner!  Simply because he arrived a day late for the special!  Come on Chili\'s!!  For shame!  The restaurant was not busy so it wasn\'t like they would have had to make people wait because of him; it probably would have cost you what maybe $2.00 to actually feed him?!?  I applaud the family that had enough respect and patriotism to feed one lone American Hero when a multi-million company wouldn\'t.  It\'s people like that family that make me proud of the country I live in; however the manager, well there was no greater disappointment in a human being then I had for her last night.  I have family all over the states with retired members of the Navy, Coast Guard, Army and the Air Force. Our son is an active duty Airman in the Aif Force and we are so proud of im for carrying on that Veteran\'s legacy in protecting and serving his country. We have all grown up knowing that the military has sacrificed many and fought hard for the very freedoms that I think that manager takes for granted.  We as a family and several friends have decided we will not spend our hard earned money at Chili\'s again. '",,status,,2012-11-13 16:01:03,29,19,0

106027143213_10151171253203214,"b'I am EXTREMELY DISAPPOINTED AND PRETURBED TONIGHT because of my Chili\'s experience in SULPHUR, LOUISIANA. I am a mother with a one year old and seven year old at home. I had a guest over visiting from Texas and we ordered Chili\'s TO GO. I was FINALLY going to try the Chili, which I was totally in the mood for, and couldn\'t believe I had never tried it because I\'ve been to Chili\'s very often. (ALTHOUGH I WILL NEVER BE ORDERING OUT AGAIN). Not only was I disappointed whenever my guest returned with my food and everything was in it, including the salad (I ordered a Chili/salad meal deal), BUT THE CHILI. Yes, I PAID for a CHILI. I have the confirmation of my order in my email account. BUT MY GUEST asked the guy if it was our food after waiting for 30 MINUTES, and whoever was working there checked the bag and the receipt and said it was ""all there""---(I don\'t live a hop, skip and jump away, mind you, and I have children that I obviously didn\'t want to take out or I WOULD HAVE)...anyway, my chili was missing, everyone got to eat BUT MYSELF and then we checked the bag for our receipt for a refund for the chili, and THERE WAS NO RECEIPT. I have no receipt, they told me to either go BACK OVER THERE and pick some up (NOT A HOP SKIP AND JUMP AND I\'M A MOTHER WITH CHILDREN THAT CAN\'T GO OUT TONIGHT) OR just come back tomorrow and get a discount? Seriously? You deprived me of my dinner that I ORDERED AND PAID FOR, I have no proof over the phone, so I can\'t go get it, I can\'t get reimbursed for something I DID NOT GET TO ENJOY YET PAID FOR, and I\'M SUPPOSED TO USE THE GAS to go on BACK over there for another 30 minute wait with my children or GO TOMORROW when I CANNOT and ""You\'ll remember me?"".....get some better, professional etiquette, people, you are a CHAIN, not some mom and pop place. Thank you robbing me of my measley 8 bucks. I know it\'s not a lot to you, but I don\'t get to eat out often, and when I do and PAY for it, I\'d like my steaming bowl of chili as the rest of our order gets to eat....THAT WAS THE POINT. NEVER NEVER NEVER AGAIN, after getting food poisoning from the one in LAKE CHARLES and this incident, you can keep my 8 bucks, and I\'ll keep my consumerism away from the likes of you and anyone else I can tell by word of mouth.

She tells her friend hold on I'll be right back, and seats us.\nAs we are walking I look around and notice the staff just hanging out in the back on their phones. The floors were dirty, and lots of empty glasses.\nWe sit down and we wait for our waitress whom was I guess apparently busy so a walking by waiter took our drink order. At where I'm sitting I can see in the kitchen, so i can see the waiter arguing with a female I presumed to be our waitress and he begins to take our food order. He takes I decide to go to the restroom and wash my hands, I go in and the bathroom is a mess. Water and trash everywhere I was in and out.\nI come back to the table and wait a while till our food comes out. When it does most of the food is cold. Also It is average at best. At this point a third waiter starts to tend to us, and he informed us that our waiter was sick and had left. Great he was handling my food. So we wait for an eternity for our check and we decide that it wasnt a fluke, the bad service is a trend.I hope that you handle this issue and I also suggest THAT NO ONE IN SAN ANGELO RETURN TO CHILIS OF SAN ANGELO the overall performance is terrible.""",,status,,2012-11-10 22:59:44,0,7,0

106027143213_10151109507988214,"b""The Chili's in Macon, GA really needs to get their act together for their lunch service. I was there today with 4 co-workers and experienced what might have been the worst lunchtime restaurant service ever.\n\nMy 4 co-workers arrived at 11:56am and were promptly seated. I was caught in traffic and arrived at 12:03pm (I know this because they texted me to find out where I was - I was getting out of my car). When I arrived at the table, our first server was taking drink orders. We all placed our drink orders and she left to fill those. Approximately 15 minutes later, we still had no drinks, nor had we seen our server again since placing the order. Finally, we caught the attention of one of the hostesses, who directed the front-of-house manager to our table. She apologized, left the table, and returned with a new server who would then handle our table. He left and immediately returned with our drinks, and took our food order. I ordered a triple-treat sampler, another co-worker ordered a burger, another the soup and salad, and the two others the 2 for $20 special, consisting of cheese fries, one with ribs one with steak. The co-worker who ordered steak asked that the broccoli be substituted with apples. The co-worker who ordered the soup and salad also had your Facebook coupon for a free appetizer. She ordered the cheese sticks.\n\nApproximately 20 minutes later, an expediter brought out the cheese sticks. We finished those around the same time that the manager returned to check on us. We let her know that the two co-workers who had ordered the 2 for $20 had not received their cheese fries. She again apologized and on her way to the kitchen, another expediter brought out the fries. Those were finished when the second server returned to our table, checking on us. By that time three of us needed drink refills, and we informed him that we had now been sitting at the table for nearly 40 minutes and still had not gotten our food. He obviously knew that, but 40 minutes later, it obviously needed to be stated. In the meantime, other tables around us, who had arrived after us and placed their orders after us, had already received their food, some of which included appetizers prior to their meal.\n\nAbout 5 minutes later, he returned from the kitchen with all of the food, with the exception of the co-worker who ordered the soup and salad. The co-worked with the ribs requested BBQ sauce to go with the ribs, He stated that it was coming right out, though he disappeared for at least 10 minutes. A third server stopped to check on our table, and we informed him that the soup and salad co-worker still had not received her food, the BBQ sauce had not been brought out, and the co-worker with the steak had received broccoli and apples, instead of the mashed potatoes and apples that she had ordered. She left and the manager immediately returned with the third server and the soup and salad, and BBQ sauce. The manager told the soup and salad co-worker that her meal would be comped, as it should have been at that point.\n\nThe mashed potatoes came out about 5 minutes later, as we were all finishing up our meals. The second server returned with drink refills around the same time that the masked potatoes came out. I informed the server that I needed to go ahead and settle my check as I had to leave in the next few minutes (I had an appointment about 35 minutes up the road, and assumed that I would have had plenty of time to eat lunch and get out of there to make my appointment when I arrived at 12:03pm). He left to get my check, and returned just a few moments later. I quickly checked my check, handed him my card, and headed to the restroom. I returned just a minute or two later, and found that he had not returned with my check, but was rather delivering food to another table, then left to go to the bar to get a margarita for another table, and then proceeded to the point-of-sale to process my card, as well as print the checks for the rest of my table.\n\nI received my check and card, asked for a pen, but was ignored. One of my co-workers provided a pen, I signed my check, and left. I got back into my car at 1:16pm - that's 1 hour and 13 minutes from the time I arrived for lunch. One of my co-workers called me and informed me that appetizer ordered by the co-worker who had her soup and salad comped, ordered using the Facebook coupon, had been placed onto her bill and she had to argue with the second server about having given him the coupon and eventually had it taken off her bill. She also had the server split the check for the 2 for $20 meal, which took him another 5 minutes and the help of the manager, to accomplish. However, after all of that, he charged both meals to her card. The other co-worker ended up having to pay her back with cash as they had already been there for an hour and 20 minutes at that point, and with an hour lunch break, they were already 30 minutes late and still had a 10 minute drive back to the office. They ended up leaving at 1:18pm, a full hour and 22 minutes after they arrived.\n\nI'm posting this story because whoever is in charge to know that this is unacceptable by all means. If you want lunch business, you have to provide lunch service. An hour and 22 minutes is extremely long even for dinner service (for instance, my wife and I were in and out of Carabba's a couple weeks ago in under 45 minutes, and that included appetizer, salad, entree, and dessert!) I only hope that this is an isolated incident, though it if it is not, you may want to consider discontinuing lunch service at this location.""",,status,,2012-09-27 17:59:36,7,9,0

The Twins are awesome (easy to remember) and so are many of the others and the service is very personal and we leave with a smile.  Before St. Judes became personal, the staff there had a way of touching us as customers without pushing and we would donate never realizing that in time a dear friend would be there with her baby boy Matthew Robert Pierce who recently received his 2nd BMT in the Chili\'s Care Center.

They only had 1 section open in the entire restaurant due to lack of servers, so we agreed to sit down in the crowded little area that was open, both my boys were starting to get over stimulated, and their was to much noise, that lead to a complete and total meltdown, everyone just kept on staring at us and making faces, the table behind us even had the nerve to tell us if we could control them and have them sit down because they were disturbing them. my reply was no i can\'t sorry they have fragile x and autism. She just turned around and rolled her eyes like a IGNORANT person would. i didn\'t want my kids to ever go through that so i got up talked to the manager and without hesitation he moved us to a area where no one was sitting it was just myself, my husband and our 2 boys along with all their flapping and clapping :) the manager came to our table and told us never to think we are bad parents, we are doing everything we can to make sure our children are comfortable, and so much more nice things I\'ve never heard anyone else tell me besides my husband.

106027143213_10151070905383214,"b'Today a friend and I decided to eat in your restaurant in Southaven, MS.  The whole experience started off bad!  First there was no juice to order for my 1 year old.  All you guys had to offer was milk and soda!  Most parents rely on a restaurant to offer some kind of juice for kids.  Second of all the food was nowhere near as good as it usually is.  It tasted like it was not cooked right!  I am guessing because you guys were under staffed that day.  The hostess was apologizing for this though.  Still I didn\xe2\x80\x99t say nothing because I have worked in restaurants and I know how it is to have a bad day.  So I understand that and I was still planning on coming back to eat there.  We left the restaurant and went to do a couple of other things when I realized that we had left my baby bottle on the table.  And this is the only bottle that she would drink out of.  I had bought several very expensive bottles and she didn\xe2\x80\x99t want to have anything to do with them.  So I called Chili\xe2\x80\x99s to tell them that I was on my way back to pick up the bottle when they inform me that they threw it away!!! WHAT!!! It hadn\xe2\x80\x99t even been 2 hours!  They didn\xe2\x80\x99t even try to hold it to see if I came back to get it, they just threw it away.  Then the employee put the manager on the phone and he was very rude to me and he said that they were not liable for stuff left in their restaurant and when they see stuff left on the table they just throw it away.  He didn\xe2\x80\x99t apologize or anything.  We was very sarcastic and rude!  So I am guessing your telling me if someone leaves their purse on the table you guys are just going to pick it up and throw it away.  Who cares if they may come back for it!!!  Now I am having to listen to my baby cry all night because she doesn\xe2\x80\x99t want to drink out of this other bottle!  I would like to thank you guys for that!!!  And so you know we will never eat there again and I will be posting this on every single website there is that rates restaurants and all my friends on facebook will know that obviously chili\xe2\x80\x99s is not a very family friendly restaurant!

We call upon you to immediately reinstate this server with a formal apology AND pay for her missed shifts and the tips she would most likely have received.

Kids where in their best behavior but by the end kids will be kids and they did started to make a noise. I was telling the kids to keep it down when I was interrupted by this male waiter who began to tell us how there is other customers trying to enjoy their meal and that having them be that loud was unacceptable and that if we didn't tell the kids that THEN HE WOULD!!!  After feeling completely shocked, confused and insulted I went and talked to the waiter myself. I told him that I didn't appreciate him going over my table and telling me that, like I wasn't trying already to\nKeep the kids quiet. I also reminded him that Chilis IS A FAMILY FRIENDLY restaurant unlike a 4-5 star restaurant, 90% of the people that go to eat there have kids! As a parent you do the best that you can to keep your kids from behaving( which they did\nThrough out the whole meal) and if people where gonna really be bothered by little kids making little noise that they themselves should probably go to a 4-5 star restaurant with no children allowed. I fail to make you understand that the burst of loudness was no more than it would take you to laugh out loud at a funny joke. Waiter was already close to us when this happened so it's not like we here disturbing other customers. I love my Chilis and the other waitress' apologized profusely for his behavior... I didn't not feel the need to tell a manager since there where nothing wrong with the food just the attitude of one particular server. This would be understandable   if you have kids that are rowdy and maybe running up and down or screaming or jumping in the chairs ( which ive seen plenty)through out the whole meal.  \n""",,status,,2012-05-23 22:49:20,1,4,0

Once seated, we waited almost 10 minutes before a server approached our table.  Our appetizer never arrived, our server was way too busy to check on our table.  A manager never came to the table when we complained about the service, and our check wasn't adjusted to make up for the mistake.

My favorite time of year is the St. Jude Fundraiser. I asked to be a Hope Captian this year for two very special reasons. The first being that if it were not for St. Jude Childrens' Research Hospital, I may have never met my best friend Ashley; at 7 years of age, Ashley was diagnosed and began treatment for Ovarian Cancer. She is alive and well today at the age of 28. The second reason I love helping St. Jude is that I have been blessed with a healthy child and I feel it is important to support the families of the sick. St. Jude never turns a child away because of the inability to pay and I never want them to have to start because of lack of funding. Please give with your whole hearts this year whether you are making a donation or asking a guest for a donation. Let's make sure everyone gets to meet there future BFF :)""",,status,,2010-08-31 16:41:18,2,0,0

OK, I\'ll try the ""new"" Pulled Pork Tacos.  Well, these were four very small greasy tortillias filled with dry, tasteless pork (is this where any left over baby back ribs go?).  They are served on this ridiculious rack and topped with this too tangy barbecue sauce.  Made with Shiner Bock..i\'ll have to take your word for that.  As small as they were and as hungy as I was, I could only eat three of them, that\'s how bad they were.  Now that I realize that it works out the each of the measly tacos cost over $2.00 each.

Not only did I stop going there until I won a 50 dollar giftcard, but I ended up with another 50 dollar card because they botched my curbside so badly, we had to order pizza that night. And, unsurprisingly, that meal sucked also. I'm not a fan of dried out ribs and pink burgers, and really how hard is it to remember when a loaded BAKED potato is ordered and not give me plain regular ones. Not to mention cold vegtables that are barely tender. I used to love Chilis, but the quality of the food, and certianly the service has gone way downhill. I've gotton into arguments with staff they they did not get my meal wrong/forget something. I'll put my money out for TGI Fridays if  go anywhere, at least they have a rewards program and seem to care about getting it right the first time.""",,status,,2009-12-12 11:01:51,0,1,0
