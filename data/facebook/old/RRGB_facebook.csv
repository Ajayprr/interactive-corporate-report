I really wanted you guys to know the whole story so you can understand where I\'m coming from so here it goes..\n\nAs a stay at home mom, I don\'t get out much. I don\'t have many friends and I don\'t get to interact with adults very often. My days are spent caring for a six, four, and two year old. As much as I love being a mom, it\'s exhausting. All I look forward to every day is when my husband gets home from work so I can have a few minutes to myself or some time out of the house.  On Saturday, I actually got a little more than a few minutes. I wasn\'t by myself but I got to spend some one on one time with my six year old daughter. We enjoyed some shopping and decided to grab a bite to eat. She is a very picky eater, but she LOVES grilled cheese and I knew it was on your kids meal menu. So in we went to Red Robin in Hamilton Town Center. Our waitress was sweet, very friendly, and tended to us well. I can\'t complain about her service one bit. But this isn\'t about our waitress, this is about a special young lady named Dezzy. Dezzy came out with my second round of sweet potato fries and she was just simply amazing! I told her that my eyes had been bigger than my stomach because I was too full now that I had finished my burger to eat anymore fries, that I would probably burst if I ate anymore. She laughed and joked with me that she would wheel barrel me out if I needed her to. We laughed together and when she stopped she looked me in the eye and said, "" You know, you\'re the only person who has talked to me today"" gave me a hug and said thank you. As you can imagine, my heart just kinda warmed right up. So there I am hugging a stranger feeling a little emotional, thanking her as well. Because you see, nobody had taken the time to really talk to me either. Nobody ever does and that\'s why I appreciated that interaction with her so much more. I\'ve never had a complete stranger hug me and thank me just for a little conversation, but I will tell you one thing, it sure felt wonderful. So thank you Dezzy for making this sheltered stay at home mom feel like a part of the world again and making me realize that I can make a big difference in someone\'s day, just like you did in mine. \n \n\nRed Robin people like Dezzy are special and I felt like you needed to know how lucky you are to have her as part of your team \xe2\x9d\xa4\xef\xb8\x8f'",,status,,2018-02-12 15:53:30,5,1,0

But the money came out of my checking account right then - I was able to look up my checking account and see the money was gone.  I couldn't get a receipt, and called the waitress who called over the manager.  I showed the manager and the waitress our account.  The manager said there was NOTHING SHE COULD DO, so she charged us again. We have a large family, so it was a big bill to begin with.  $189 with tip and tax.  (The bill seemed high, but looked right.)  Now it's double that.  SO out of our account this morning, was $360 for burgers.  You better believe I'm upset.""",,status,,2018-01-29 13:30:33,4,2,0
7854678793_10156072362083794,"b'Normally, I like Red Robin. I eat at your Columbia, MD store. Last night, we celebrated my nephew\'s Birthday at your Newnan, Georgia store. What a disappointment.\n\nSeveral people\'s food came out cold. Refills of drinks and bottomless food never came. All around inattentive service. But the worst part was that I ordered something off the menu (I am vegan) that was literally purported to be vegan. ""Order the veggie burger vegan and get it with bottomless broccoli."" I asked for my veggie to come vegan. The first time it came with cheese on it and with fries. I sent it back and repeated that I wanted it vegan. The second time it came with mayo and fries again. At this point, I just told them not to bring anything but just to take it off the check. \n\nOne of the other guests (another aunt) manages another restaurant in the area. She tried to talk to the manager to get this all addressed. Apparently, they took a slight amount off both checks. But the manager never came by our table. He didn\'t seem interested in making things right and there was no apology from him and barely one from our server.\n\nEveryone else at the table ate their food while I sat in front of an empty place setting. How embarrassing and uncomfortable. I ended up going to Subway and getting a salad on our way home. \n\nI am disappointed and saddened by the treatment we received and by the lack of service and redress once we made the manager and the server aware of the issues.\n\nCertainly, I will not go to the Newnan store again, and I will now need to think about whether or not to go to any of your other places if this is the level of service we can expect in the future.'",,status,,2018-01-29 13:17:42,0,1,0

Email stated the food would be ""ready for pick up"" in 52 minutes from the time we placed the order. In an effort to find out what was going on we called the Gresham Oregon store over and over again and could not get through. The menu stated to click 1 to order or 3 to talk to someone. We clicked both several different times and all it did was route us back to the main menu. Since I wasn\'t home at the time I tried calling for 30 minutes and so did my husband. I finally got through and explained my frustration and he simply says ""oh sorry about that"". After checking with the delivery specialist he says that it is for delivery. At this time I tell him it\'s already been 20 minutes past the 52 minute window previously stated. He then says they are just running behind. I tell him I will have to come by to get the food since it\'s already been almost an hour and a half and we weren\'t sure if we now had to pick up the food. He said someone will be walking out the door to deliver in 5 minutes so I decided to drive back home. We are still awaiting the food and it has been 42 minutes past the 52 minute time frame give.

When she was very little, maybe 18 months old, we went for dinner and Red Bird came over to our table to give high-5's. She had such a large reaction, we had to leave early. Ever since then, we were unable to go to Red Robin with her.  She would stay home with grandma or an aunt. Recently, on a trip without Jolie, we noticed our Liberty MO restaurant had remodeled. We also noticed there was no more Red Bird!! After a lot of convincing, Jolie made a fearful trip inside for dinner. Here is the picture of how our dinner went!!! She had a wonderful dinner :) We had the best service from Stephen!  And Jolie is so excited to go back!

When our appetizer did not come out after 30 minutes, we asked our server & she said she would check on it. She goes to the kitchen & inputs the order then tells us it will be right out - as she's walking by our table - never stopped. About 2 minutes later, our entrees are coming to the table - still no appetizer. When I refused them until our appetizer arrived, the manager accused me of yelling at her and was mad I wouldn't accept the entrees. Once we finished the appetizer, our food was brought again (not convinced it wasn't the same food kept under the lights.) Below is a photo of the plate my entree was served on with a good portion of the corner chipped off. Two of our appetizer plates were also chipped like this. \nNot once after the issue with the missing appetizer did our actual server return except to present the bill. Manger had said she would not charge us for the appetizer. This was not done until we asked. \nThe dining room was not busy when we arrived. There were multiple empty tables, but by the time we left it was pretty full. Our meal took nearly 2 hrs from start to finish.

7854678793_1467019083315893,"b'Dear Red Robin,\n\nI\'m writing hoping for help. Red Robin has always been a special part of our wedding anniversary celebration every year, for 25 years so far and we\'ll be celebrating number 26 in just a couple of days. We have a love that really began in a booth at Red Robin. I swear I can still see the rain on the window that night and smell the wonderful aroma that is Red Robin, and hear the staff singing happy happy birthday and suddenly, the group of us were all cracking up at something this guy across the booth from me said... and his blue eyes twinkled. Like actually twinkled! I know how it sounds, but they did!! That was it for me, I was in love! We were married 3 months later. Every year since then on December 16th (and many many times in between) we go to that location (Everett WA) and wait as long as we have to for ""our"" booth and eat and exchange gifts. On the very first year, I had ordered a taco salad, and as the server set it down, I could see a dime sitting there mixed in with the cheese. Before we left, my hubby asked if we could keep the dime. Later, I\'d receive a framed dime with the Red Robin coaster as a gift (pic attached) and it\'s been on our wall since. \n\nSeveral years back, as a gift for my husband, I asked management there if I could have a very tiny plaque put at ""our"" booth if I had it made and got permission from management. After we told friends and family, a few of them have even asked to wait for that booth. Attached is a picture of it. Last year, however, we got a sad shock. The restaurant was being remodeled, and everything had been taken off the walls, including our tiny sign. The area that had our booth was blocked off and when I saw it was gone, I burst into tears. We never had a honeymoon, but we had Red Robin! The staff there was so very sweet, and opened up that area to just the two of us, but no one knew what had happened to our sign. As it turns out, I purchased 2 of them! (attached pics) I would like to get formal approval to place the second one in our booth. I know staff changes happen, and while a few people remember us, the people I got permission from have all changed. We would very much like to continue our tradition, and will be there again this year on friday, Dec 16th, for our 26th anniversary. Please allow us to place this teeny tiny plaque at our booth for the next 25 years, it would mean so much to us, you have no idea! My husband is my favorite thing in the world, and it would make him SO happy!

The week before we ordered fried pickles and loved them a basket full of fried pickles whats not to love. Well this time we ordered them again to get a basket of fries with a few pickles on top. Why would i pay for that when i get fries with my burger? When we finally get our burgers we had to take the slimy black spotted lettuce off to eat them. I emailed online and sent them pictures of my problems i had and was told i would hear back from the franchise within 48 hours and i have heard from no one not even a response from there corporate office. You can remodel a building but it wont make crappy food any better. Id rather spend my money at bagger daves and get quality food',,photo,https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10209798225171223&set=o.7854678793&type=3,2016-06-18 10:20:45,0,2,0

His wheelchair does not fit in the stall designated for wheelchair accessible. He cannot fit his hands where they need to go to lift himself onto the toilet, one hand balances on the wheel and one on the back of the toilet. This leads to countless times of not making it to the toilet in time to urinate in it. Then to top that off the soap dispenser is a push kind that cannot be reached... my bf who is an LPN happened to be using the restroom at the same time and helped him this time but also had this wonderful vet show him how he had to move around and struggle to use the bathroom.  Something needs to be done.

We asked to see the printed nutritional menu and he chose the prime rib dip sandwich,  note that it lists a carb count of 121g. We calculated an insulin corrected dose based on this information.  After his meal he felt Dizzy and nauseous when we checked  his blood count it was in the 30s! A quick Internet search and looking at what we found on Red Robin's nutritional app we found the actual carb count for his meal was only 69-76g.  That means he had taken almost twice the amount of corrective insulin for this meal.  This is totally unacceptable!  I returned immediately and spoke to the manager who though was nice,  understanding and compensated our meal in form of a gift card.  However these menus are a corporate responsibility and need to be corrected in all locations.  I'll be filing a complaint with @red robin gourmet burger Corporate and the local public health authority Monday.""",,photo,https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=983908918395637&set=o.7854678793&type=3,2016-05-15 00:42:41,3,9,1

7854678793_1356133134401250,"b""A story about a man who went the extra mile for my little girl!\nThis past weekend we went to a Timber Rattler game in Appleton,on the way home all the girls wanted to have supper at the Red Robin. We had a great dinner and the service was awesome! However, when we arrived home (almost an hour away), Katie realized she had left her brand new, custom made softball headband on the table at Red Robin. This resulted in many tears from Katie. I was able to track down the phone number via FB of the Red Robin on Stoneybrook road in Appleton! The staff were so sorry and promised to look right away. I was feeling not a lot of promise that it would be found, or perhaps had been taken by someone else.\nHowever, the manager called me back within 25 minutes to tell me that it had been found!!\nThe tricky part was getting it back to us. This amazing man actually offered to drive the headband to us, or meet me halfway. The guy lives in Howard, WI well over a hour or so away from me.\nI explained that this just wouldn't work out with our schedules. So he offered to overnight the headband to Katie via FedEx. He felt that if it was that important to Katie, she would definitely need it before her next softball game. He had daughters and felt very empathetic towards Katie, realizing that athletes are often attached to certain things that bring them luck.\nToday the package arrived!!\nWe are ever so thankful to Chuck Tietz at the Stoneybrook road Red Robin in Appleton, WI!!!\nIt does a moms heart good to see that many wonderful people still exist and are willing to go the extra mile to make a 9 year old girl smile again, and of course to make sure she's ready for her next game!!""",,photo,https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=1356133134401250&set=o.7854678793&type=3,2016-05-07 16:35:10,5,2,0

It originally came with a bun and they had to take it back and wrap it in lettuce. That wasn't a big deal. But when I got it, it had barely any sauce, only a few mushrooms, no onions and no blue cheese crumbles. Translation....no flavor. I had already sent it back once so I did t want to say anything, but I did tell the waitress later. The manager came over and informed me that the burger only comes with he blue cheese sauce and mushrooms. I showed her the picture in the menu and description and said that it gives a false impression of what you get. She agreed and apologized. Let me say that my server Erin and the manager were extremely polite and accommodating and also, despite me protesting, took the burger off the bill. But I left very disappointed and unsatisfied with the meal itself. I have included pics of the menu. Either the menu needs to be changed, or the locations need to be informed on how the burgers are supposed to be made.

She ordered one of the Gourmet Burgers and I decided to splurge and ordered the Black & Bleu from your 'Finest' menu. I did not place a complicated order, my only request being no sauce. When the burger arrived there were no blue cheese crumbles and there was lots of sauce. An irritating kitchen mistake, however, understandable, everyone makes a mistake every now and then. I informed my waiter, who apologized for the mistake. When my second burger arrived, the bun was barely toasted and there was nothing on it aside from onion and mushroom. The manager came over and asked if everything was ok and I informed him of the missing blue cheese crumbles, he promptly brought me out some. I took one look at the burger and wanted to send it back again, however, I was extremely hungry, and my girlfriend and daughter were already halfway through their meals, so I ate it.\nI wouldn't even rate it as ok. The bun was toasted in a very small section and felt cool when I picked it up, the patty was warm at best, and the tiny serving of onions and mushrooms was greasy and cool.\nBased on the menu picture, and I know the real thing will never look like a perfectly staged advertising photo, I was expecting an amazing burger and all I received was something that has turned me off Red Robin for a very long time, if not completely.\nHere is a photo from your website next to a photo of my burger.

That alone wasn\'t awful (it was after all Friday night) but combined with the fact that when my food came it was incorrect it only added to my frustration. I had ordered my burger plain and it had come with all the fixings. The waitress noticed and whisked my burger away to get me another. (On a smaller note my son asked for apples and got fries but that was quickly corrected). My burger came back in record time which was impressive (although suspicious). I then noticed the bits of lettuce stuck in my burger. So I flipped it over to see mayo smeared all over the back. The cook who ""replaced"" my burger hadn\'t even bothered to wipe the mayo off. I was disgusted and lost my appetite at that point.  The management took my burger off the bill and then the night got even better with your new ""toys"" I went to pay. I had a $25 egift card that the waitress took off and then I went to pay the rest of my bill and the machine wouldn\'t print a receipt and it wouldn\'t leave the payment screen.

I regularly visited the chain in Kentucky and was excited to share the experience with my boyfriend, who had never been to the chain.\n\nToday, Friday January 1st, we decided it was time to give the Melbourne, Florida location a try. We figured now that the location has been open for a few months that they would be running smooth. We were dead wrong. We recieved the text message saying we had approximately a 20 minute wait at 14:51 (2:51pm). We were seated at 15:16 (3:16pm). In the few minutes it took our waitress to arrive to our table we were ready to order.\n\n2 burgers with fries. That's all. No appetizers, no food allergies, no special requests. 2 burgers with bottomless fries.\n\n45 minutes later... NO food. Nothing. Our waitress never came back to give us an update. No manager coming by to check on us, although we sat with empty glasses for more than 15 minutes. Nothing. \n\nThat is absolutely ridiculous. It's a damn burger!!! When there are empty tables in the restaurant there is absolutely no reason for it to take so long.\n\nSo, at 15:57 we left. We are done! We will never visit Red Robin again and you can be sure that we are making sure everyone we know, knows about our experience.\n\nWe went to Burger King across the street. Got 2 big ole' fat burgers for the price of 1 of yours... and we had it in less than five minutes.\n\nI'm sorry we ever stepped foot inside your establishment.

7854678793_702970510279,"b'This evening my husband and I decided to have dinner at your South Charlotte, NC restaurant (3415 Toringdon Way).  We have both eaten there before and had great experiences.  Tonight was not like our other visits.  Our waiter, whose name is John, never introduced himself to us.  I found out his name by looking at our receipt at the end of our visit.  John was very inattentive and came by to check on us one time in the 45 minutes we were there WITHOUT being waved over by my husband.  Not once did he ask how the food was or offer to refill our drinks.  He was very unpleasant and didn\'t seem interested in taking care of his customers.\n\nI ordered the Avo-Cobb-O salad which was probably the only highlight for me during our meal.  However, I received less than 1/8 of a cup of dressing for the huge salad that was set in front of me and had to request more.  I had several mouthfuls of dry salad before John ever brought the extra dressing to me.  I had also ordered a side order of fries but did not receive those with my meal and the person who brought the food to us did not ask if everything looked ok and left before I could mention that I was without part of my order.  My husband had to wave John over to our table to even get him to notice that we had not received all of our food.  It was at least 5 minutes after we had received our food that I finally got my fries (and the extra ranch dressing for my salad).  When I did finally get my fries, my first thought was, ""Seriously??  I can get more fries than this at McDonalds cheaper than what I am paying for them here.""  (I am attaching a picture of the side order of fries I received.  In it you can see that I was only given approx. 8-10 fries.)  \n\nI know that you have bottomless fries that you offer at your restaurants but 1) a side order of fries should include more than 8 fries and 2) our waiter would actually have to do his job for me to be able to take advantage of the bottomless fries.  My husband and I are severely disappointed in the lack of care and service we received tonight at the South Charlotte location of your restaurant and it may be a while before we visit after this experience.'",,photo,https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=702970510279&set=o.7854678793&type=3,2015-12-28 19:27:55,0,3,0

7854678793_995025333877655,"b""So I went to dine in at the Red Robin at the Bay Plaza Mall, all excited to finally try one of their burgers. Well, it wasn't such a pleasurable experience. I asked for a well done burger. I bit into the burger thinking that my order was fulfilled correctly. After nearly taking a second bite, my intuition told me to check. I received a rare burger along with cold fries. Not only was my food cold but the kids meal for my little sister was cold too. After my complaints not only was the waitress rude but so was the manager. I has sent my food back twice, the first two reasons being they put mayonnaise on sandwich when I requested none for the burger and the cold kids meal. That site needs to be checked because I wasn't the only dissatisfied customer that night. As a result of a horrible dining experience, I don't think I will return to any Red Robin.""",,photo,https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=995025333877655&set=o.7854678793&type=3,2015-12-08 13:04:41,1,4,0

I figured since all this time passed they had to be well done. One bite into mine and I'm greeted with a pink, COLD burger - FOUL. Was sent back and the girl did ask if I wanted another one. Who wants to sit there for another 20 minutes in front of their friend waiting like an idiot while they eat or while they tell you it's ok they will wait and their burger gets cold? What is even worse is they removed the one burger from the bill which was great but we only get further into the second one and it was still kicking and screaming. Totally ruined our night. McDonald's was across the street...they cook their burgers correctly but we stay from disgusting food. Now we can add your restaurant to the list!\nThe server was very nice and the manager offered desert. If they can't get a burger cooked right, why would I want them to bring us more food? All nice gestures but I really wanted the cook to be dragged out to the table and have them explain to me WHY! At 10 bucks a burger I would have expected to get it cooked. Everyone has their own preference of how they want their meat cooked and everyone will poke fun of others on if it's still kicking and screaming or totally dead.

7854678793_535644399924906,"b""Very bad experience at Red Robin in Plymouth, MA today.  I went for lunch with  a friend, two three year olds and a one year old.  The table we sat at had jagged wood on the side the kids were seated on.  My daughter had on her brand new $75 halloween Disney princess dress (we were off to an event after lunch) - thanks to the jagged wood, it ripped a huge hole in the front of her dress.  She sobbed about her dress being ruined and it truly is past the point of repair.  We told our server who shrugged it off but when my friends daughter got HER dress stuck on it, we asked for tape to fix it.  Never an apology or anything from Red Robin.  Very disappointed - we were frequent customers and would have at least expected a bit of sympathy after an unsafe table ruined a child's costume. \n\nI am attaching a photo of the table - this was after it had been taped off.  Very dangerous.""",,photo,https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=535644399924906&set=o.7854678793&type=3,2015-10-18 21:40:12,0,3,0

We are requesting that memos be given to their managers, employees, and all franchises, to make it clear that refusing service to or verbally abusing our LEOs and Veterans in uniform, will not be tolerated! We are asking that employees be dismissed immediately for these actions! A public restaurant is not an appropriate place to push a racist and violent agenda towards LEOs or Veterans. We have drafted a list of chains with their FB pages that need to be contacted by as MANY people as possible. We have also, drafted a cover letter to copy and paste on their FB pages to make this as easy as possible. If there are others that we have missed please feel free to contact them as well and post the letter to their FB page.

Unfortunately, in recent weeks, we have become aware of Employees and Management of many 'fast food' stores disrespecting Police Officers and Veterans in uniform by writing notes on food packaging and verbally refusing service to Police Officers and Veterans while on duty and in uniform. In addition, your attorneys should brief you on the Law Enforcement Officers Safety Act, which in effect, allows an on-duty officer to open carry in any place that it is not prohibited or restricted on government property. All your employees should be made aware of this law! As Americans, and Veterans, we stand with millions of Americans who see this behavior as unacceptable! We are requesting that all fast food and dine in chains send memos to all store Managers, Employees and Franchise Owners, and adopt a company policy of immediate dismissal of any Employee found to have committed this discrimination or harassment. Our goal, is only to get cooperation, but as we have seen, such incidents can lead to Boycotts and Nationwide outrage. We would like to think that the customers who support your business are ALL important to you. Those who put their lives on the line for our safety and freedom deserve respect from all who live under the veil of their bravery and sacrifice. We are requesting a response to let us know that you have addressed this issue, and that your employees have been informed of your policy, or change in policy...Thank you Sincerely for your cooperation in this matter.\n Your Customers""",b'Red Lobster',link,https://www.facebook.com/redlobster/,2015-10-18 14:24:14,0,2,0

It\'s really worth it please give it a try!\n""In less than two weeks, I\'ll be taking to the Republican debate stage in Boulder, Colorado for the third showdown with my shrinking field of opponents for the GOP nomination for President.\nThe national media -- desperate to push party establishment picks and turn this campaign into a TV reality show -- wants nothing more than to blackout my message of liberty and limited government.\nSo my campaign is preparing to launch a massive TV and Radio Ad Blitz to flood Iowa airwaves during and after this critical debate.\nWill you please chip in $20.16 or more immediately to help make this a reality? \nhttps://secure.randpaul.com/?oct20t&sr=1017fb1\nMy staff has run the numbers, and we need to raise $200,000 by Tuesday, October 20th at midnight to make this work.\nWith your support, we can bust through the media blackout and send shockwaves through the media and the national political establishment.\nFor the first time in decades, you and I have a true chance to nominate a Republican who will take a sledgehammer to the Washington Machine.\nIf elected, that\'s exactly what I\'ll do.\nMy plan to institute a 14.5% flat tax, and return $2 TRILLION to the American people, isn\'t just designed to get our economy moving and create jobs. It\'s designed to blow up our current tax code and force government to live within its means.\nMy plan to impose term limits in Washington, D.C. isn\'t just designed to change a few faces in Congress. It\'s designed to clean house of Big Government career politicians.\nMy plan to force Congress to read the bills they pass isn\'t just designed to force members of Congress to stop passing thousand-page bills at the last minute, it\'s designed to END lobbyists\' grip on Washington, D.C.\nIf elected, I will fully REPEAL ObamaCare, end domestic government spying and finally audit and expose the damage the U.S. Federal Reserve has wreaked on our country.\nNot one of my opponents can make any of these promises.\nIn fact, they wouldn\'t even dare.\nWhile they may toss some red meat out every once in awhile to try and fool primary voters, they think everything is ""A-OK"" with Big Government.\nBut the truth is, our nation is over $18 TRILLION in debt and spending is STILL increasing!\nPoliticians in BOTH parties have almost succeeded in wiping the Fourth and Tenth Amendments off the books.\nNow, they\'re coming for the First Amendment\'s protection of religious liberty and our Second Amendment\'s right to keep and bear arms.\nEven after the release of videos showing Planned Parenthood officials admitting they routinely abort unborn babies, dismember them and then sell their body parts for profit, our elected officials will hardly lift a finger to defund them!\nEverything is not ""A-OK.""\nAnd with the stakes for our country higher than ever, we can\'t afford another Republican nominee who will betray us.\nWe desperately need a President who will completely pull the plug on the Washington Machine and start over.\nWhether it\'s forcing the Obama administration to back down on the use of drones targeting U.S. citizens on American soil, President Obama\'s attempt to rush to ISIS\' aid in Syria, or forcing the worst of the so-called ""PATRIOT"" Act\'s provisions to expire, I have proven I will stand up to anyone in either party to uphold my oath of office.\nBut you do have a choice.\nYou can choose to return to the constitutional principles that have made America great.\nYou can choose a candidate who can not only DEFEAT Hillary Clinton, but is committed to restoring the principles of liberty you and I hold so dear.\nSo please help me by chipping in your most generous contribution of $20.16 right away. \nhttps://secure.randpaul.com/?oct20t&sr=1017fb2\nWe only have until Tuesday, October 20th to hit our $200,000 goal. This is the most critical moment of my campaign to date. So every dollar counts.\nI\'m confident this TV and Radio Ad Blitz in Iowa is just what we need to break the media\'s stranglehold on my campaign.\nBut this plan can only be successful with your help.\nWith my deadline rapidly approaching, will you please chip in a contribution IMMEDIATELY? \nhttps://secure.randpaul.com/?oct20t&sr=1017fb3\nWill you help me bust through the media blackout?\nThank you in advance for your generous and continued support.""

Fantastic experiences every time.\n\nI wish I could state the same fantasticness in regards to how employees are treated.  (Take care of employees & they will take great care with your business.)\n\nIt has come to my attention that some of your supervisors & management at the Albany Oregon location are not up to speed on treating their women employees well.  It is 2015!  There is a nursing mother at that location that quite frankly is being treated like poop.  Besides the State AND Federal Laws protecting this woman's right to pump breast milk for her baby, WHO in this day and age wants to deny that awesome gift for a child or be so rude as to make a Mom feel like she shouldn't do the best thing for her baby.\n\nI have to assume the inappropriate conduct by those supervisor members is NOT the entire Red Robin businesses stance on supporting Women, Moms and Babies.  PLEASE Educate ALL locations on this matter.  \n\nWomen deserve a safe work environment.  Women deserve to give the gift of breast milk for their babies.  Women deserve a SPACE and TIME at work to pump breast milk.  \n\nPlease support women and educate your establishments.  You never know when waves of women will come proudly dawning their breast pumps while enjoying delicious burgers.\n\nSincerely,\nShowing Women Support\nRobin N.

I'd also prefer a little shorter equipment so I could see my wife a little better. Your food is delicious, but you gotta remember to keep it simple when it comes to your tables.

We had just ordered our food and we were talking to eachother when my boyfriend looked over at the wall and noticed the two slugs on my side of the booth. We called our waitress over and told her we would be moving booths and showed her why. She said, ""oh my gosh, that is gross! Uh....I\'ll be right back."" She went to get the manager and he walked over to the booth and gave us a very dirty look, almost an accusing look of us bringing the slugs in! He was disgusted and walked away to get a to-go box and scooped them in there and said, ""they didn\'t just get in here, they obviously were brought in."" He never came over and apologized for our experience, he just walked away, nelecting to clean the booth further. Once we were served our food in the booth right next to it, another couple came in and sat at that exact booth, that still hadn\'t been cleaned. They ordered their food and asked if the manager was there, because they were friends with him. He walked out and sat in the booth with them for about 10 minutes, before we started to leave. After we paid, which we weren\'t ""comped"" for our bill, which we aren\'t worried about, my boyfriend proceeded to the booth to tell the couple that their friend, the manager, neglected to clean up where the slugs were. He then said, ""there wasn\'t anything else to clean up,"" with a smug look on his face. No apology. Just continued to sit and talk to his friends on company time.

I had just driven two hours to and from the airport to pick up my mom. On the way home I thought we would eat at the new Red Robin. I took my three girls out of the car and we were told that we were being turned away because we didn\'t have reservations for their soft opening event. I said I didn\'t know that we needed them and explained our situation. One nice lady asked her manager if they could accommodate us after she looked into the seating area - the manager\'s response is why we will never eat at this Red Robin - the manager said ""No, we can\'t. It\'s almost break time."" It wasn\'t that we didn\'t have reservations, it\'s that they were going to take breaks. Don\'t tell me one thing and then tell an employee another. That\'s lying and you\'ve lost a customer. And then I get this in my email today.

They took the charge off of our order. But when I asked to get a free burger next time I\'d like to come back, he said that they don\'t normally do that once reimbursed.  Mind you, all I ate was my salad, because the burger was ""Mooing"" at me. I ordered ""No Pink"". (I was still hungry and not about to go back to the store for a fresh burger at 10:15pm.)And the mgr argued with me. I don\'t complain about my food or service normally. This is the first time I\'ve ever had issues there. However, all I asked for was a free burger for myself the next time I\'d come in. And the Mgr acted like that was going overboard. I didn\'t expect a free meal. Just a free burger. If I expect a well-done burger, and I call at 9:45pm. You damn well know that I am not coming back into the store to get a new burger. \n\nHe did reimburse my meal. I\'m happy with that. He is going to send me a $10.00 gift card to replace the burger now via mail. But I shouldn\'t have had a MGR argue with me when I received a ""Mooing Burger"" served with a side of E-Coli inside of it. \n\nThis doesn\'t mean I won\'t return back. We\'ll just go to the Olympia Restaurant from here on out. We\'ve had exceptional service from them. \n\nJust keeping Corporate in the loop about the service given here is all. I don\'t expect anything out of this. Just hope they won\'t give another customer a hard time when they\'re served a side of Mooing E-Coli in the future. \n\nI also have a copy of the ""Check Receipt"". \n(Check # 60045 from that store for your own reference)\n\nHave a great day!'",,photo,https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10206511782211445&set=o.7854678793&type=3,2015-07-12 17:17:30,0,6,0

This brought my 11 year old niece with Celiac Disease to tears. Why? Because this /used/ to be her favorite dish that was available at your restaurants. We might be done visiting you now and go back to our local Isaac's. Don't feed me the bs line about the better greens either because if you're paying 3 times the price for good greens than you were paying for iceberg, you all need new suppliers. And yes, I do know that for a fact as I am one of the primary grocery shoppers and we live on a tight food budget. Please correct this heinous error in judgment or fix the ludicrous price you charge for it.

7854678793_10205352257423211,"b""So the family and I went to RR at the Renton Landing yesterday.  The food and service was mediocre, not bad but nothing special.  As I sat there talking and waiting for my food, I glanced up toward the Air conditioning vent (it was a bit cold) and noticed a crazy amount of dust.  I looked around more and all the railings and material on the ceiling was caked with dust, I mean this has easily got to me months and months worth. I even noticed a bunch on the light above our table, GROSS.  I mean how am I supposed to feel about what I am being served when the place looks like this?  We have always enjoyed going to Red Robin as a nice little family outing, but as we waited for the check we had a serious discussion as to whether we would return.  I just don't get the feeling that they really CARE, if they leave the restaraunt looking that way, scares me to think of what CARE is going into the food.  We have been LONG time (loyal) customers but after yesterday not sure. Something needs to be done.""",,photo,https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10205352257423211&set=o.7854678793&type=3,2015-05-18 14:13:32,4,1,0

7854678793_10153592530659202,"b'I wanted to share that last night we had the WORST EVER experience in a Red Robin restaurant. :(  We planned to have dinner last night at the Kent east hill location (in WA) and the entire experience was awful.  \n\nArrived at 5:50pm and there were 2-3 parties stacked up in the lobby who hadn\'t been greeted yet.  My father went back and found a host (had been setting up a table for a party of 25).  We were seated ~6pm.  Our party consisted of 6 adults and one child celebrating her second birthday.\n\nWaited at least 5 minutes for our server to take our drink order.  \n\nWaited at least 10 minutes before our drinks arrived (diet cokes, club sodas and waters) and our dinner order was taken.  \n\nAt ~6:45pm we observed that the couple who had been in the lobby with us were leaving the restaurant, having eaten and paid before we even received food. At this point we asked our server how much longer our food would be and without checking with the kitchen she said, ""it should be up soon.""  \n\nWe ordered:\n\n1) BLTA croissant (made correctly)\n2) Chicken ensenada platter (the salad had no dressing and a knife was not provided to cut the chicken)\n3) Southwest chicken salad (made INCORRECTLY - TWICE).  This was ordered with dressing on the side and both times it came with dressing on it.\n4) Cobb salad (made correctly)\n5) Lettuce wrapped monster burger (made INCORRECTLY on a bun)\n6) Bacon cheddar burger on gluten free bun (made INCORRECTLY on a regular bun and had to wait at least 15 minutes for it to be remade).  This was my meal shared with my 2 year old daughter which meant that two of us had virtually nothing to eat while we waited for it to be remade.\n\nMy stepmom had finished her BLTA before the SW chicken salad and my burger arrived back at the table.  \n\nWe requested a manager who came out within a couple of minutes and while polite enough, STILL didn\'t ensure that our meal was delivered correctly.  \n\nWhen the manager returned with some of the food (fry refills, but no salad or burger) he said he would take 50% off of each check (we were on 3 checks, meals 1&2, 3&4 and 5&6).  \n\nThe initial check arrived and it was for all 6 meals and 4 drinks, discounted 50%.  My father walked the check to the manager (in the expediting area of the kitchen) and asked him to please have it split.\n\nThe second round of checks arrived with the meals split correctly, the drinks split incorrectly and without any discount.  My father walked the checks BACK to the manager AGAIN in the kitchen. \n\nThe third round of checks arrived with the meals split correctly and the discount applied.  Getting our corrected checks took AT LEAST 20 minutes.  \n\nThe whole experience from start to finish was absolutely wretched.  With a 5:50pm arrival time on a Wednesday evening at our neighborhood location (not a bigger location like Southcenter), I expected to be feeding my toddler by 6:30pm and it was WELL after 7pm before our food arrived.  \n\nMy husband and I both worked for Red Robin years ago (my first real job was as a hostess for the Pier 55 location) and I NEVER saw a customer have an experience this bad.  \n\nI doubt we will ever return to that location, which is unfortunate because it\'s the most conveniently located.  \n\nAlso, I messaged this page and Katie responded that I should go to http://bit.ly/1Cl9xBN but it was not clear where to provide feedback.

We all ordered our drinks, I got my diet soda but my sisters rootbeer float was no where to be seen. when he came back 10 mins later to take our food order, we asked for her drink again & the waiter apologized & said he thought he had seen someone grab it & assumed they had given it to us. He took our food order & said he would go check on her float. 15 minutes later 2/3 of us were brought our food, the 3rd person was told their order was still cooking, we again asked for the float & finally got it. We tried to wait until everyone had their food before eating, the server came back to refill out drinks & my brother in law asked about his food, The server said he was sorry but it was still cooking! My sister & I decided to start eating since our food was getting cold. I took a sip of my soda refill, Looked down into my glass & saw something frozen inside of my ice cube, I fished it out & found a little yellowed chunk. repulsed, I showed it to the waiter whom after examining it said ""oh, that looks like just a seed"". I stared at him & the seed until he admitted that it was ""kinda gross"" & offered to bring me another drink. When my replacement drink arrived the waiter also announced to us that the burger basket we had been waiting for this whole time was given to another table & that my brother in laws food had to be reordered. This came at the same moment my sister took her second bite & realized the egg she had asked for was missing from her burger. he said he could remake it but at that point we had been there so long that my sister just decided to eat it plain. (by the way, we went to Red Robin Gourmet Burgers mainly due to the ""free Milkshake promotion"" I had to order it twice, ask about it 3 or 4 times (He told us after asking the 2nd time in a very frustrated tone that he had to wait until they made it & put it out. but then he came back to ask us what flavor we wanted (so obviously the order was never put in to begin with) Beyond Annoyed, This was the point where my sister got up, Gathered her stuff & announced she would meet us in the car.

Just 5 weeks ago, I was begged to rescue Chloe, a 5 year old Umbrella Cockatoo from Maluku, Indonesia who has been suffering from a potentially fatal condition called ""prolapsing"" in which the inner tissues of the cloaca protrude (hang out) from the vent, exposing the intestines.  It\'s treatable but she needs attention 24/7 to ensure that the herniated intestines don\'t dry out, thereby killing her or that she erupts them by attempting to push them back in herself.  She\'s responding very well to my hands on treatment in addition to increasing the humidity she gets exposed to several times daily.\n\t\nI need your help to raise social awareness so that this problem, in addition to other self-destructive issues amongst endangered cockatoos and other parrots in captivity, stops.  Please share this cause that I set up amongst your friends and family:  Spread awareness about preventing self-destructive parrots  In addition, I set up a fund raiser for Pink Pearl\'s Parrot Rescue so that we can continue to help these poor animals: https://www.youcaring.com/manage-fundraiser.aspx?frid=261101 \n\nThank you for caring and paying it forward by sharing!

Our experience was NOTHING to write home about BUT it was definitely worth writing Corporate about!!! Let's start with the unsanitary conditions that were throughout the restaurant. (Please see the picture below and additional photos in comments) it took ME 3 baby wipes to get our table clean enough to feel comfortable sitting down. All around the edges and underneath were caked with gunk. The window, window sill and the small area of wall looked like it had not been wiped down in MONTHS!!  The blinds showed evidence of splattered food, finger smudge, spilled drinks and flat out grime!! Backs of chairs (the wood part) were spotted with greasy hand prints so visible I saw it 3 tables away. It was very unappetizing. As for as our food, we ordered the towering onion rings and they were good, and our Waiter David was great at his job. We pointed out the filthy areas and you could tell he was genuinely embarrassed. Our food came, we had the Whiskey River Burger, the Whiskey River Wrap and the kids Mac n Cheese. The burger was not smiling at all, it was missing the tomatoes, and it was so drenched in sauce the bun was soggy. My wrap was missing the tortilla strips and it too was over sauced. The Mac n cheese is now Kraft!!! Yuck!! Way to cut cost RR!!! Bring back the good Mac!!! My daughter hardly touched it. It was dry and just plain gross. It's not made with real cheese!!! My entire visit was a complete disappointment, not only as a guest but as a past employee who knows all too well the standard as to which the facility and food should be held too!! The Mgr came and spoke with us and did all she was supposed to do, but even a good Manager cant undo our below par experience!!""",,photo,https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10203843807390190&set=o.7854678793&type=3,2014-11-29 16:57:17,1,11,0

State, 136 Ind. 306. This\n premise was upheld by the Supreme Court of the United States in the\n case: John Bad Elk v. U.S., 177 U.S. 529. The Court stated: \xc3\xacWhere the\n officer is killed in the course of the disorder which naturally\n accompanies an attempted arrest that is resisted, the law looks with\n very different eyes upon the transaction, when the officer had the right\n to make the arrest, from what it does if the officer had no right. What\n may be murder in the first case might be nothing more than manslaughter\n in the other, or the facts might show that no offense had been\n committed.\xc3\xae\n\nAn arrest made with a defective warrant, or one issued without\n affidavit, or one that fails to allege a crime is within jurisdiction,\n and one who is being arrested, may resist arrest and break away. lf the\n arresting officer is killed by one who is so resisting, the killing will\n be no more than an involuntary manslaughter.\xc3\xae Housh v. People, 75 111.\n 491; reaffirmed and quoted in State v. Leach, 7 Conn. 452; State v.\n Gleason, 32 Kan. 245; Ballard v. State, 43 Ohio 349; State v Rousseau,\n 241 P. 2d 447; State v. Spaulding, 34 Minn. 3621.\n\nWhen a person, being without fault, is in a place where he has a right\n to be, is violently assaulted, he may, without retreating, repel by\n force, and if, in the reasonable exercise of his right of self defense,\n his assailant is killed, he is justified.\xc3\xae Runyan v. State, 57 Ind. 80;\n Miller v. State, 74 Ind. 1.\n\nThese principles apply as well to an officer attempting to make an\n arrest, who abuses his authority and transcends the bounds thereof by\n the use of unnecessary force and violence, as they do to a private\n individual who unlawfully uses such force and violence.\xc3\xae Jones v. State,\n 26 Tex. App. I; Beaverts v. State, 4 Tex. App. 1 75; Skidmore v. State,\n 43 Tex. 93, 903.\n\nAn illegal arrest is an assault and battery. The person so attempted to\n be restrained of his liberty has the same right to use force in\n defending himself as he would in repelling any other assault and\n battery.\xc3\xae (State v. Robinson, 145 ME. 77, 72 ATL. 260).\n\nEach person has the right to resist an unlawful arrest. In such a case,\n the person attempting the arrest stands in the position of a wrongdoer\n and may be resisted by the use of force, as in self- defense.\xc3\xae (State v.\n Mobley, 240 N.C. 476, 83 S.E. 2d 100).\n\nOne may come to the aid of another being unlawfully arrested, just as\n he may where one is being assaulted, molested, raped or kidnapped. Thus\n it is not an offense to liberate one from the unlawful custody of an\n officer, even though he may have submitted to such custody, without\n resistance.\xc3\xae (Adams v. State, 121 Ga. 16, 48 S.E. 910).\n\nStory affirmed the right of self-defense by persons held illegally. In\n his own writings, he had admitted that \xc3\xaba situation could arise in which\n the checks-and-balances principle ceased to work and the various\n branches of government concurred in a gross usurpation.\xc3\xad There would be\n no usual remedy by changing the law or passing an amendment to the\n Constitution, should the oppressed party be a minority. Story concluded,\n \xc3\xabIf there be any remedy at all ... it is a remedy never provided for by\n human institutions.\xc3\xad That was the \xc3\xabultimate right of all human beings in\n extreme cases to resist oppression, and to apply force against ruinous\n injustice.\xc3\xad\xc3\xae (From Mutiny on the Amistad by Howard Jones, Oxford\n University Press, 1987, an account of the reading of the decision in the\n case by Justice Joseph Story of the Supreme Court.\n\nAs for grounds for arrest: \xc3\xacThe carrying of arms in a quiet, peaceable,\n and orderly manner, concealed on or about the person, is not a breach of\n the peace. Nor does such an act of itself, lead to a breach of the\n peace.\xc3\xae (Wharton\xc3\xads Criminal and Civil Procedure, 12th Ed., Vol.2: Judy\n v. Lashley, 5 W.

7854678793_10203421933367560,"b""Red Robin would prefer not to service African Americans.  So since they can't tell African American not to enter the restaurant they hire one African American waitress and hope she is on duty to service the African Americans.  My family entered the Red Robin located in West Babylon, NY and was placed at a table and left there until their African American waitress came on duty.  While we were waiting we observed about 6 servers sitting around and the entire restaurant only had about 6 parties to serve.  The place was empty enough for one to get their food quick.  We were able to photograph some of the staff sitting around who could clearly see us sitting there.  When a white couple walked in about 5 minutes one of the servers gladly and quickly approached the couple and took their order.  We still sat there waiting.  It wasn't until their African American server came on duty that she came over to our table and asked us if were were being served because she noticed were had been sitting there for a while.  She said that wasn't her station but she would help us.  To make matters worse.  The MANAGER was circulating stopping by the tables asking the customers if everything was okay.  No once did he come to our table.  When the server told the Manager that we said we had been waiting for a while he told her to just serve us.  I guess he didn't want to be bothered.  What a disgraceful visit?  From what I hear, we were not the first Black couple who complained about not being served in the Red Robin Restaurant.  Your money is powerful.  You don't have to patronize an establishment that will disrespect you.  Take your money somewhere else.  If everyone does this Red Robin will be in the Black very quick.  Either with bankruptcy or lawsuits.  Either way, if you believe there is no place for this type of behavior in 2014 speak up by taking your business some place else.""",,photo,https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10203421933367560&set=o.7854678793&type=3,2014-09-15 23:49:15,1,8,1

7854678793_10203411973638573,"b""I can't believe the service that we receive at this Red Robin Location.  I was saddened by the service this establishment provides.  The staff doesn't like to service African Americans.  My husband, daughter and I arrived at this Red Robin Location.  The hostess at the front provided us with a welcoming greeting.  We were then seated and that's when we witnessed the discrimination that the servers were exhibiting towards us.  We sat seated for approximately 15 minutes and no one came over to serve us.  The restaurant was pretty empty at the time because it was about 3:55pm when we were seated.  As we waited we photographed approx. 3 waiters standing in one corner, 3 sitting in a corner booth and one walking around.  Guess What?  The restaurant wasn't even busy.  It was half empty.  About 15 minutes a white couple was seated in a booth across from us and immediately one of the waiters standing around came over to serve them.  We still sat waiting. We continued to photograph the servers sitting around looking at us and no one coming over to service us.  The manager who was supposed to be greeting all of the customers never even came over to ask us how things were going.  It wasn't till an African American waitress came on duty that she noticed that we had been sitting there and not served.  She came over to help us.  The manager was well aware that we were sitting there because when the waitress walked away he walked up to her and told her to just continue to serve us.  We weren't even sitting at her station.  The waitress that was supposed to have our station was a white woman who the manager told our waitress that she was on break.  We continued to photograph what we were witnessing.  During our whole time in the restaurant the Manager never came over to our table yet he made sure he visited the other white parties that were seated after us.\n\nOutraged is the only word that I can say.  This is the same situation that occurred with the Denny's restaurant and the African American Community was outraged.  That is why I continues to photograph what occurred so that I can submit the evidence of what happened at our first (and only) visit to Red Robin.  \n\nI can't comment about the food because the situation that occurred left such a nasty taste in my mouth it was awful!""",,photo,https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10203411973638573&set=o.7854678793&type=3,2014-09-14 12:59:31,0,1,0

I do not usually complain and am a really easygoing person, but our service was so slow that our food was lukewarm when it was delivered to our table other than my soup. My soda had a funny flavor like there were bitters in it or the lines need cleaned. The staff did a nice job of wishing my husband a happy birthday, but my daughter's fish and chips and his fries were not freshly delivered to our table, and my salad was not cold like you would expect (I also didn't expect there to be a ton of cheddar cheese on a house salad). I can not recommend this Red Robin and see from their page my experience was not unique.

Whatever burger was brought to my table, it surely was not the ""Colossal"" burger that I saw when I entered the restaurant. \n\nThe server was very polite and knowledgable and the Manager came by to see how things were. I expressed my feelings about the burger. He did offer to replace the burger and even pay for it. It was not my intent to get anything for free. I don\'t know if the cooks do not know how to make the food you serve or they simply just don\'t care. I took a picture of what came to the table and of one from your advertisement, as a comparison.

The link to the ballot is http://www.mascotinsider.com/2014-favorite-mascot-of-the-year-poll-round-one/  RED has been nominated in the ""Favorite Not Listed Category Mascot."" \n\nBalloting began July 12 and will end July 26, so vote today and tomorrow and then for the next 9 days:  1 vote per day.  \n\nRED is honored to have been nominated and now, to be in competition with legendary mascots like the Philly Phanatic and Benny, the Bull is awesome.  What makes this ballot so exciting is RED is nominated in the same category as the Mouse of Disney fame and fortune.  RED is awestruck.  \n\nRED, however, is a competitive bird and enjoys a great challenge and would like to put a ""scare"" into the hearts of its competitors...well, RED would be happy with just a handshake but thinking small gets robins no where, so lets go after the gold and focus on taking on the world...since Red Robin is international.  RED certainly would like to be the ""Favorite Mascot for 2014"" through Mascot Insider.  \n\nAll in good fun, great food and wonderful brand marketing:  Red Robin, YUMMMMMMM!!!   Thank you for voting.  RED tips its hat to our guests.  \n\n'",b'2014 Favorite Mascot of The Year Poll Round One (Open)',link,http://www.mascotinsider.com/2014-favorite-mascot-of-the-year-poll-round-one/,2014-07-13 16:26:27,0,3,0

7854678793_808599142486213,"b'Greetings again.\n\nA while back I shared with you a less than stellar experience I had in one of your restaurants and unfortunetley I need to do so again.\n\nLet me point out something from the outset: earlier in life I worked close to 10 years in fast food; I started on the line and worked up to becoming a manager; I know things can get messed up, especially in the heat of a lunch or dinner rush & with a staff of young adults. That experience is why I dont go ballistic when errors happen; I have been there. However it is because of something else I have experience with that I feel I must bring situations like what follows to light.\n\nI have a intolerance to gluten; it isnt one of those deadly allergies like a peanut or egg allergy (the paranoia I feel is bad enough, I cant imagine what those poor folks go through) but it can really screw with your day when triggered. My body hates gluten so much I dont risk eating something even just manufactured in a facility with wheat; just the dust will scramble my guts, and as such the rare event of going out to eat can be a nerve wracking experience for me.\n\nRed Robin has always been an oasis in the sea of restaurants I avoid, a safe port in a storm.  But something seems to have been slipping for a little while now and my confidence is no longer as strong.\n\nLast night, 6-15-14, we called & placed a to-go order at your Holyoke MA location; one of two locations in our area we visit. For myself I ordered my usual: Royal, protein style, with the GF fries (no seasoning). For my wife, her usual: Banzai Burger, also protein style (she doesnt have a gluten problem, she just likes it better that way) with turkey instead of a beef burger.\n\nThe place was quiet when I got there; everyone was their usual friendly self and I only had to wait a couple of minutes for the order to come out. When I brought the order home I gave the box marked Banzai to my wife and took the box marked Royal for myself.\n\nWhile unwrapping her burger my wife was surprised to see a strip of bacon protruding from her burger - the Banzai burger does not come with bacon - and upon closer examination noticed an egg as well; we double checked the writing on the boxes; they were mislabeled.\n\nI had not eaten any of the burger in my box, no harm was done, a quick switch of boxes and all was better...except, as I said above, in my confidence. \n\nWhen you are as paranoid as I have become your mind goes all over the place when things like this happen; like: what if two identical burgers had been ordered - something with lettuce, tomato, mayo & ketchup - but, because one person in a party had an egg allergy, one burger was ordered without mayo. When heated mayo turns clear; what If a person with a egg allergy got a mislabeled box.....?\n\nI dont want anything, no one needs to call or write; I just want the confidence I had in RR to eventually be restored. I know you guys try and I dont have any answers how to make the issue go away; I just hope it does.\n\nThat is all I wanted to say.\n\nAlthough, in closing, let me ask you this: Have you ever been to Disney World? My wife and I have been there better than 30 times now. People sometimes look at us like we each have two heads when they hear this but there is a reason other than it being a fun place for us: there is no better place to eat if you have a food allergy - period. We go there to relax and I truly can. If anyone in your office frequents WDW at all, have them make reservations at all the WDW restaurants they eat at on their next trip saying that they have a food allergy and ask them how it went when they come back. \n\nIf you are interested in my experience there & have some time to kill, check out this blog post I wrote a number years back; its wordy but, I think, informative. We were there again in May and had a nice relaxing time:\n\nhttp://kobolila.wordpress.com/2009/12/15/the-disney-gluten-free-dining-experience/\n\n\nHave a MAGICAL Day!\n'",b'The Disney Gluten Free Dining Experience',link,http://kobolila.wordpress.com/2009/12/15/the-disney-gluten-free-dining-experience/,2014-06-16 13:06:48,0,1,0

I am not so sure about anymore.  We arrived at 6:50 to a half empty restaurant (and a COMPLETELY empty bar section).  The host told me it was a 40 minutes wait because the kitchen was backed up.  We ended up waiting because we enjoy Red Robin.  We were seated in the empty bar area 35 minutes later.  As soon as we sat down, we put our order in (the waiter advised us to because of the kitchen).  We ordered at 7:20, and our food finally came out at 8:10.  The picture below is how my food came out.  50 minutes later I received my chicken sandwich with a breast that barely covered half the bun.  This tiny breast for $8.99?!

It consisted of overly macerated possibly pre-frozen strawberries (the same that go in the Freckled Lemonade), apple chunks, and mandarin oranges (likely from a can) all floating in a sugary syrup. I believe this menu item is in desperate need of change, and should consist only of fresh seasonal fruit.

Our waiter was completely key in on everything and not once did I have to worry about her food being made. They even assured me the fries were even gluten free. Not only that our waiter kept informing us of certain things on the menu that were gluten free for future visit.

7854678793_10200600261800398,"b'My mom and dad were great R/R customers at the Des Moines restaurant visiting 2-3 times a week. They loved the staff and the staff loved them. My father passed away last July, but we kept the tradition alive with my mother. Pretty much, each Monday night, my boys, granddaughter, wife and I would meet my mother for dinner in Des Moines. The staff would greet us with huge smiles and hugs. They would stop to visit between customers and let my mom know how much she was loved. If we could we always sat in ""Mom and Dad\'s"" booth. March 25, Brenda and I met my mom, and a dear friend for dinner, sitting in ""her booth"". This was the last dinner my mom had and the last time I saw her alive. She was so happy, laughing and joking with us and the staff, although she missed John who went to manage the Kent, east hill location. With her tummy full, she marched out, got in her new car and drove home. She passed the next morning.\r\nAfter a long day, we stopped by R/R Des Moines and gave the news to the staff, they were as shocked as we were. The next evening after running around and trying to get over the shock of my mom passing, we stopped in and had dinner, in her booth. Tina Bird was our waitress. She was so loving! She asked if it would be okay to get a plaque made and mounted at the booth dedicated to my parents. \r\nMonday, May13 after mom\'s internment, the whole family met at Des Moines R/R for a celebration dinner. My parents would have loved that!\r\nThe Plaque is up!\r\nI want you to know, this staff has touched our lives bigger than just a restaurant. They are our friends. It is good just to sit and watch how they truly communicate and care about each customer and make their visit complete.    \r\nThank you for keeping Red Robin an experience and not just a restaurant!'",,photo,https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10200600261800398&set=o.7854678793&type=3,2013-05-23 11:24:07,56,9,7

The burger that i received belonged on the dollar menu at McDonalds or worse BurgerKing.  Not eating out much, and stopping at a Gourmet Burger Restaurant I would think you would have a total different product.  On both burgers that were purchased, my girl friends and mine , we received one thin, wilted leaf of lettuce (romain), and a very thin almost transparent slice of tomato. C'mon... A little crunch with your burger is what you want isnt it??? FYI.. your staff and management at this location are spot on, being in management myself, great group and clean restaurant...

I was told by the manager that it never happens and this is the first time. From the looks of that flag, it showed no evidence of ever being respected. I dont think it has ever folded in his life. Im not saying there needs to be a Honor Guard each night to fold the flag.

(The picture is from that trip...)\r\n\r\n\xe2\x99\xa5 Red Robin Gourmet Burgers: A Love Story. \xe2\x99\xa5\r\n\r\nI first went to Red Robin when I was 3 weeks old. It was love at first sight, even though I couldn't eat solid foods yet. For every birthday I can remember, I've chosen to go to Red Robin. For most of my life I would refuse to even touch a cheeseburger anywhere else.\r\n\r\nAfter we found out I had celiac disease, I was afraid to go to Red Robin again. I knew I could get my burger wrapped in lettuce, but it just wouldn't be the same. But the first time I went back, I was informed that Red Robin not only has gluten-free buns at most locations, but dedicated fryers as well. Their special seasoning salt is free of gluten, and so is their ketchup. I've never once gotten sick from Red Robin, but let's be honest: if I did, I would still go back.\r\n\r\nTwice in my life I have had to deal with the horrible pain of seeing a Red Robin being replaced with an inferior restaurant. The last time this happened was just a little over a year ago. When I got that email I cried. Luckily, even despite this, I have never lived outside of a 15-mile radius of a Red Robin. I never plan to.\r\n\r\nAfter almost every surgery, the first thing I crave is a Red Robin cheeseburger. No matter how nauseous I am, or how much I have been vomiting, a Red Robin cheeseburger pretty much ALWAYS sounds good. I think about them often. I have written poetry about them. I even dream about them. I could probably be a vegetarian, if Red Robin bacon avocado cheeseburgers weren't holding me back.\r\n\r\nMarket to the swing group through the eyes of the love group, my teacher always says. Well, as far as Red Robin goes, I AM the love group. I will be a customer for life. Their service and their burgers have no parallel as far as I am concerned.

Especially after a 30 minute wait just to be sat at a table that was beyond dirty. We had two waitresses and the Manager wipe the table but the grime was still there. The waitress said that the grime was part of the table. WTH The place they sat my 2 year old\'s High Chair was Nastier than a Bathroom floor. I wonder if the CEO would sit their child down at a table like this.\nSo the twins were nice enough to let me use a whole bag of baby wipes to show them how to clean a table.

Chad and Tanis are so caring, understanding and willing to do whatever they can to make us comfortable.  The steps they take go above and beyond, they make sure we are safe and happy EVERY time we visit. \n\nYou seem to get more complaints and it's time you get some much deserved compliments.  You make life for people with food allergies/Celiac disease easier.  You give people the fun of a night out in a regular restaurant and don't make us feel like we're bothersome.  Your staff has ALWAYS been great, even while traveling to other locations.  Not all of them understood the precautions that Chad & Tanis take, but were always more than happy to accommodate us.

Neither was well done. The minute the burgers were put on the table, the stench from them about made a couple of us sick. Neither of the burgers were eaten because they were so gross. The server (who by the way did a great job) explained that they have a new grill which replaced the previous cooking method and it is the ""flame-broiled taste"" that some people either really love or really hate.\n\nBeing a burger restaurant made famous for its burgers, that was a bold move to change something so drastic to your namesake food. They said it was a corporate move, not sure if that is true or not...but, I digress. It was not good. What a shame. :-( I have had better ""flame-broiled"" burgers from Burger King...and those aren\'t even that great. I, and the rest of the people at the table, wished you hadn\'t made that decision.\n\nHowever, the French Onion soup was delicious!

Waited 15 minutes for drinks, 50 minutes for 2 burgers and kids meals.  We watched the wait staff saunder around chit chatting with each other instead of taking care of business.  The only person doing their job was the bus boy!  When the food came a ridiculous amount of time later it was not even warm.   No exaggeration.  The food was room temperature and had obviously been sitting around for a long time.  \n\nWe returned everything except the kids meals (because they were starving and on the verge of tears) and asked to speak to a manager, who we were told couldn\'t talk to us at that time because she was busy cooking in the kitchen.  When she finally did show up, she apologized, informed us that they were having some ""issues"" and she was going to credit our bill for ""most"" of the food and come back with a coupon for a free appetizer for ""next time"".  15 minutes later, we received a bill for $24.00 (we indeed got charged for everything except our returned food), and she NEVER came back to give us that promised coupon.  When we left we saw her back in the kitchen cooking.  I guess her promises were just lip service.  \n\nSadly we watched at least 5 other parties with similar issues leave angry and unhappy for a variety of reasons.   This was a HUGE fail.

Had 3 people in our party and went to Red Robin spur of the moment after much debating on where to go eat. Was the worst meal I ever had. Ordered the double tavern as did one other person in my party. Ordered them extra well cooked, even made a comment that I did not care if it was burnt. The other person was a child and had the kids burger and fries. Finally got our food and the other adult started eating the burger while I ate my fries, after a few bites I saw her spit out a bite and say look how pink this is. I cut my burger in half and could not believe how much pink was still in it. I would not have minded so much but we specifically ordered them extra well done. Finally caught the waitress and she said she would bring out new ones and she did apologize. In the meantime the child got to eat all her food as we still waited for ours. After at least ten minutes we got our new burgers delivered by the manager who very quickly said sorry, set the burgers down and ran. They were still just very slightly pink in the center. By then I had lost my appetite as that grosses me out. Tried to eat a few bites of the burger but just could not do it or enjoy it. The other adult ate about half of hers and thats all. Mean while the child was just sitting there, the waitress or the manager could have at least offered her a dish of ice cream or something since she was just sitting and waiting. What a waste of money and time, so disappointed. We like to do birthdays and such there and were very disappointed, it will be a long while before going back.

No, I do not want avocado at the point we are paying our check and walking out the door. We also had issues with the fries being undercooked (not crispy at all) and bathed in salt. When we mentioned this she only apologized and did nothing to make it right. Is your staff empowered to provide a positive guest experience at Red Robin?

We ordered our food and asked for the burgers to be well done. We received our food after at least 20 mins. I cut my burger open and it was still very pink. I had to wait at least 5-10 min for someone to come near so we could ask them to make  me a new one,  she was so nice and said of course. This women was not our waitress that was supposed to be helping us.  I know stuff happens no big deal big kitchen etc. Then I went to the restroom with my daughter the manager I assume came over and let him know that she was going to make the burger how I wanted it and she wasn't going to charge us for it, really nice of her! Well they finally came with it again, cooked right but this time it had tomato and mayo I don't like that and had asked for it not to be on the burger the first time I ordered it. He said ok went back and finally made it right. At this point I didn't even wanna eat after waiting so long to finally get what I ordered how I wanted it. The waitress that was assigned to our section came over one time, we were there, we were there for an hour and a half and she came ONE time, after we flagged her down to ask her for the right jalapenos we ordered. She would help the people in the booth in front of us and the people who were sitting behind us, we were in the middle of them and she just walked by like we weren't there, I don't know if she was upset about the whole burger situation and didn't want to deal with us but that is not good customer service skills.  They attempted to charge us for two sides of jalapenos even though we didn't order the fried kind, we asked the manager of the kitchen to see if he could take it off they were still in the cup untouched, he said yeah but proceeded to tell me that he was going to have to charge us next time, I know this we pay every time no problem. We sat there with 2 napkins the whole time, she never came over asked if we needed anything or wanted more fries, we had to wait for the kitchen manager to bring my burger to me for the third time for us to even get refills on our drinks. Every time I come they always ask you and are coming by periodicity to see if you need anything else, when she gave us our check I put the phone number on it for the red robin royalty card  I looked and saw that we didn't get any credit for the stuff they did charge us for,  and when she came back and dropped the change off she was rude about it to, she just dropped it off and walked off, not a thank you or im sorry about anything, I never complain about anything but this was by far the worst service I have received.

In all the years we have been going to our Red Robin, which has been since they opened and are frequent customers always with sizable orders, I have never been told I would have to pay for extra sides of fries.

The sauce was different (maybe that it was a ""sauce"" and not a marinade). I think the lettuce was even different.  The manager and waitress were very nice nice explaining it and total corporate cheerleaders, but the truth remains that these changes did not improve on the taste or quality.  I understanding not offerring endless fries before the burgers come out; that\'s a wise business decision.  I even get no more balloons anywhere and the reusable kids cups; again, wise business decisions.  Changing your food? NOT a wise business decision.  It tasted like drive thru food.

After a while of talking we realized that our appetizer was taking a little long to show up, when a different waitress appeared with our burgers. She asked if we needed anything else and hubby mentioned that our appetizer had never come out. Just a couple of minutes later the restaurant's general manager came over with the appetizer and told us that it would be on him and apologized for the mix up. We thanked him, already pleased with the prompt solution to the problem. We lingered for a while, chatting about plans for the day. We were preparing to leave when the manager came back over, apologized yet again, and set a gift card on the table. He told us his name, shook our hands, then informed us that he had put $25 on the card and would love for us to come back to make it right!

We got our appetizer, and then waited for our food. Then we saw it. The food was placed in the heat lamp window, when the waitress finally noticed it, she looked upset. We were too. There was a chicken patty on one of our buns, complete with toppings. When the waitress alerted the cook, to say the least, he looked offended. They argued back and forth publicly and loudly, until he begrudgingly took the burger back, and ever-so-slyly replaced the chicken with the microwaved veggie patty, and promptly slammed it back up on the counter. (Sparking another shouting match.) at that time the other burger was finally ready 30 minutes after we ordered. (There were only 5 other tables in the whole place.)  reluctantly she took the plates  over to our table. I said ever so calmly, ""excuse me, I just saw the cook take chicken off of my bread and replace it with the patty. That can make me sick for days, and is unexceptwble."" She said ""well, yeah, that did happen, but its okay."" And started to leave the table. At that point it was personal. We raised our voices and said ""excuse me!"" And continued to tell her we wanted a new burger. She took the plate without saying another word. Then it got worse. My finances burger was still cold, the cheese was not melted, there were no toppings, and it was on the wrong bread. We looked for the waitress, but we didn\'t have to look hard. She was shouting back at the cook, in full public view with another woman who we later learned to be the manager. We then saw the manager smack the cook. That\'s when we had had enough. Unaware that the smacker was the manager we gathered our things and walked to the bar and asked to speak with a manager. The bartender was nice, and said \'of course\' with out hesitation. He came back from talking to the girl who was yelling and hitting the cook, and said \'the manager will be just a minute.\' At that point we decided to tell the bartender to pass along out troubles. We told him about our chicken veggie burgers that were ""okay"", our cold plain wrong bread burger, and the yelling, cussing, and smacking. We closed our argument by telling the bartender when the manager finally made time for us, to tell her that she should stop smacking employees in public view, and that we would not eat anything prepared by a cook throwing pans, and cursing customers because we would not eat a spit burger. \n\nMy fianc\xc3\xa9 and I are both professional chefs of 10+ years. We have seen some duzies in our day but this was something else. We both have friends who work at different Red Robbins\' across the country and are familiar with your corporate policies, most of which were violated that night. We will be waiting to hear how you are going to rectify this horrible, sickening experience. \n\nThank you for your time. \n\nStella and Lauren'",,status,,2013-01-08 12:24:27,0,1,0

I loved the staff at my local red robin, and never had a problem.\n\nLast week, I went in for lunch, and my order was as follows: Gourmet Cheeseburger with just ketchup and bacon, order of mozzarella sticks (I asked to have them before the burger) and, of course, those amazing fries. I also ordered a root beer to drink. \n\nSadly, to start, I had only 1 glass of root beer, despite asking for more, more than once. My waitress was...unprofessional is putting it lightly. Any time I asked for something, I got the feeling that I wasn't terribly important and/or she had other things to do. \n\nNext, my burger took almost 40 minutes to come out, and my mozzarella sticks came out AFTER them, and after I asked for them the third time, and were cold. \n\nI just...I'm really disappointed in you guys.

I don\'t usually order a drink, but to ring in the new year, decided to treat myself to an adult beverage.  Asked for the Baily\'s Shake, and was told the blender was broken.  On to plan B with the Electric Watermelon.  Well, I get halfway down the glass, and look to see a giant crack in the glass, and a few chips missing.  Of course I see this AFTER drinking half of it and any accompanying glass pieces.  We flagged down the manager who happened to be at the next table, and told him.  All he said was, ""do you want another one?"".   I was appalled.  I said no, and when we got our bill, I was charged not just for the drink with the broken glass pieces, but the Baily\'s Shake that we never received.  We told the manager, and he finally took the drinks off of the bill.  Pretty little compensation to have to ask them not to charge me for a drink I never received, and one that could have possibly injured me.  The waitress, while very attentive throughout the meal, never mentioned, it once.  Either she wasn\'t informed by the manager, or just didn\'t care. Either way, we were very saddened by such lack of concern or empathy for the situation.

I did hear as we were waiting to seat that they were down a server or two. It should have been my first notion to leave. (We have encountered this issue several times). We were seated pretty quickly tho. Our waitress was initial very nice, but that was the end of the good service. We ordered our food with out initial drink order. Almost twenty minutes later ( we had not seen the server in that time) we began to get frustrated. Our glasses were dirty, they looked like someone licked them around the rim. When we asked where our waitress was, no one knew who it was. After describing her, turns out the bartender was out waitress. (Would have been fine if we were eating near the bar) Finally the food arrived, of the 5 meals we ordered 3 had to go back because they were wrong/ or ice cold. After we had to send a soup back a second time we gave up. When speaking to the manager instead of an apology we were told we we luck to sit as quickly as we had because they were low on servers, and had the bartender not waited on us we would have had to wait longer. Never did we get an I'm sorry from the manager, only that the food being wrong or cold was not the servers fault.

Instead I had to go online with an access code to inform corporate Red Robin of my horrible experience. The form specifically asked if I wanted to be contacted and I did. After submitting the form, I received an auto generated email letting me know they will contact me in 2 days but if they don\xe2\x80\x99t here is how to contact them\xe2\x80\xa6 AGAIN. \r\n\nAre you kidding me?

The waitress came over first and said ""you cannot bring your own food in"" I said ""She has food allergies so we can."" \nWe were in the center of a crowded room. \nThe manager came over and told us we had to leave we cannot have her food here-Loud so everyone could hear. Jessica began to go get her crutches and the other kids got up to help. I again said ""she has food allergies, we are ordering food but she cannot"" ...Its terrible what happened next...and no matter how hard I explained she came back with ignorant remarks.\nWe have known allergy laws for over 18 years now. We are educated on health and safety codes and FDA rules....we were just trying to eat together as a family. The lady had the nerves to then say ""I had to kick out a group on Monday who came in with their own food and ordered water to watch the game"" as if our case was similar. Asked for a general manager...he wouldn\'t be in till Monday. Asked for cooperate phone number-she does not have it. \nNeedless to say we are asking everyone to boycott Buffalo Wild Wings until they hop on board with working with families who have life threatening food allergies.'",,status,,2012-12-02 18:34:53,13,17,0

We all needed a weekend and were excited for school to end on Friday.  \n\nWhen I got home from work my family decided to go to Red Robin for dinner, we went to the West Valley, UT location.  I still had on my faculty shirt and after we were seated the manager, Nic Turc, after seeing what shirt I had on, asked me what my connection was with that school.  He proceeded to offer his condolences and the condolences of the Red Robin family for our loss.  It was very touching to see how my pain became his pain.  A few minutes later, after ordering our burgers, Nic returned with two orders of onion rings and mozzarella sticks on the house.\n\nWe choose to go to the Red Robin in West Valley even though there is another location closer to us because of the amazing customer service and food quality there.  Even though a few free appetizers won't bring back my friend, Nic was able to ease the pain so we could enjoy a nice family dinner.

7854678793_10151248492348794,"b'Red Robin Rocks!! I was a first time customer today at the store in Orchard Park, NY. I was completely taken in by the menu presentation, the decor of the store, the great food but more importantly your superior wait staff. I have been in the hospitality industry for over 20 years and it takes a lot to impress me. Your waitress Amanda did just that! My son and I were at Dent Neurological earlier and decided to visit Red Robin. I have seen the commercials and never understood them, so I was curious. My son has orders to eat more red meat and has been a visitor to another store and really enjoyed his food. Upon entering the store, we were immediately greeted with the most genuine hello and smile. The hello and smile immediately put me at ease and made me feel welcomed not a problem or just another tip. I requested a warm area due to being chilled with the drastic change in New York weather. As we walking to a table, Amanda took her time and stood at different locations. At first I was confused, but then she announced to me that this spot should be suitable because she could feel the heat. She was right,I was pleasantly warm the entire time. As we sat down, she handed us our menus and begin to ""suggest""items. The difference here, Amanda asked probing questions and really listened and was able to figure out what I liked. I must say the gingerbread shake was to die for and completely hit the spot and started off our dining experience on a wonderful positive note. As Amanda explained the menu, she was very honest and very knowledgeable. I never felt rushed and never felt stupid or that I was taking up too much of her time. More importantly to me, she never said a word about my son or the fact that he had his hood up.(His head was wrapped in gauze due to some testing) Amanda treated us both like we were long time customers or even regulars. She smiled all the time, had a joy in her voice, and a very pleasing way about her. I overheard her talking to other customers and it seemed as though she would go out of her way to help any of her customers. She treated everyone as though they were long time customers of the store. Amanda took ownership of her presentation and her personality. It has been  a long time since I have had the pleasure of a wonderful server. Combine great food and wonderful wait staff and that store could do no wrong. I will definitely be back more and have already recommended that particular store to many. Please take the time to let Amanda know what great service she provided today. Thank you Amanda for making our day enjoyable!'",,status,,2012-11-13 18:18:30,5,4,0

When it was time to go sing her happy birthday, I and 7 servers and hostesses went to the table with the signs folded up and started off singing happy birthday to her and then at the very end of the song instead of singing ""Happy Birthday to you"" we sang ""Will you marry me?"" and unfolded the signs and held them up.

7854678793_10151243500038794,"b'A HUGE shout out to our West Hartford Team! We received an awesome letter from one of our Guests, and we couldn\'t resist sharing a bit of it here\xe2\x80\xa6\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTwo years ago my youngest daughter, Reagan, was diagnosed with Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML). She was only 15-months-old at the time. After five rounds of intense chemotherapy during an almost seven month long hospital stay, our baby girl was finally allowed to come home in May 2011. Reagan is still in remission and was recently granted a well deserves Make-A-Wish (MAW) vacation. The MAW volunteers notified our family that prior to our trip to Disney World, we would also be treated to a dinner at the restaurant of Reagan\'s choosing. Naturally, she advised Make-A-Wish that she wanted Red Robin. Here\'s where the story gets REALLY good...\r\n\r\nWe arrived at Red Robin and discovered that our table had been decorated BEYOND expectation. The staff bought Disney Princesses placemats, plastic cups, coloring books and crayons, mini-dolls and more pink & purple balloons than you could count. The Managers thanked US for being their guests and for allowing them to serve our family. My wife asked our friends from MAW if this was the reaction they received at other restaurants, and the response was essentially ""No, this is above and beyond what we normally see."" The topper on the night was when one of the managers came to our table and told us that dinner was on Red Robin. I think our MAW friends\' jaws hit the table at that one. Apparently, this too is not the norm for such dinners.\r\n\r\nI wanted to let you know what a great community organization Red Robin proved itself to be tonight, as well as give a great big THANK YOU to the team at your West Hartford location for making my Reagan\'s night so special. You should be proud to have such amazing and caring people working for you. My family has always been good Red Robin customers; however, as of tonight we are truly Loyal Customers and will be telling everyone and anyone who will listen about our wonderful experience. THANK YOU VERY MUCH!!!!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBill K\r\nWest Hartford, CT'",b'Timeline Photos',photo,https://www.facebook.com/RedRobin/photos/a.175207518793.119904.7854678793/10151243499978794/?type=3,2012-11-10 11:56:20,5289,318,268

Red Robin is his favorite restaurant, and a birthday tradition.  We arrived for lunch and had a short wait (10 min.). This was almost too much for him, as his birthday already causes overstimulation. Fortunately, your manager Ashley, recognized the situation and made sure that he had fries on the table the moment we were seated.  I know this isn't typical, and I really appreciated the accommodation to make our meal more enjoyable.  One of our other sons requested fruit punch off of the kids' menu, and apparently they no longer carry it.  Our server, Travis, created a concoction of sprite, grenadine, and some sort of orange / raspberry syrup combo that ended up being a perfect beverage for him.  To top it off, our birthday boy is dairy-free, and I had accidentally left his special ice cream at home.  Your staff provided a dairy-free smoothie for him during his birthday song, and we had over half a dozen employees singing to him, even though the restaurant was quite full. Thank you for making our experience extra-special.  Your staff went above and beyond! Thank you more than words!!""",,status,,2012-11-06 15:24:37,193,14,0

7854678793_10151233151043794,"b'After waiting for many months for your new Brandon, FL location to open, we decided to have dinner there tonight. When we walked up, there was a line outside and a girl putting names on the list on an iPad. It was going to be 45 minutes for a table for myself, my wife and our two young children.  We understood that it was Saturday night and that the restaurant has just recently opened, so we were good with waiting the 45 mins or so. We put our name on the list and were going to receive a text when our table was ready. Name went on the list at 5:59. We went and let the kids play in the play area at the mall and commented how wonderful the text deal was so that we didn\'t have to wait right at the restaurant. At 6:50 I went back to the restaurant and went inside where I stood around for 5 minutes waiting for one of the hostesses/greeters/whatever to speak to me. I realized as I was standing there that 3 other customers were aggravated that their tables were not ready in anywhere near the promised time frame. One of them talking to what I assumed was some type of manager. Eventually when I was spoken to I was told my table would probably be another 30 minutes. We ended up eating garbage food at the mall food court because there was no way our kids were going to hold out another 30 mins (nor is a ""gourmet hamburger"" worth an 1h15m wait just to be seated).  \n\nI get that, as a company, you all have to optimize seating and the queue and that you all have obviously purchased some software that is supposed to do that for you. The text thing is cool, however the software obviously isn\'t working well.  Sometimes fancy gadgetry can\'t replace the good old human brain and some paper and pen. \n\nOn top of the software issue it appeared it was mass mayhem in there amongst the employees. The 4 or 5 greeters/hostesses seemed to be tripping over each other, panicked and didn\'t seem to have any real sense of direction from management as to who was doing what. I actually felt bad for one of the girls, she just looked disappointed that she\'d accepted this new job. \n\nBottom line- get the software working right or go back to pen and paper and make sure management is actually ""leading"" the team and not just calling himself a ""manager"".\n\nWe\'ll wait a while and let the newness calm down before we give it another go..........\n'",,status,,2012-11-03 19:37:29,0,7,0

7854678793_10151191355598794,"b'Well let me start of by saying that I did not have a wonderful visit on October 4th 2012 at your Masonic and Gratiot location in Michigan! I took my 3 children and myself out to dinner for our birthdays. Yes all 4 of us in October and my children chose to go to Red Robin because they like it when you sing Happy Birthday to people. It was a Thursday night at not that busy but to my surprise.....We waited a long time to receive our order. In the meantime our waitress got three more tables at once that I know of. She became busy very quickly. We needed refills on drinks but knowing that she got really busy at once I waited patiently. I am a server as well and know how quickly a situation can become hectic fast. About 5 minuted into eating our dinner my daughter then had to use the restroom. So all four of us got up to use the restroom leaving all our coats. We come back to our table to find that all of our FOOD HAD BEEN CLEARED OFF THE TABLE AS IF WE LEFT! The busboy was behind us and apologized very quickly realizing that we did not leave. Our waitress appears and my daughter is now crying  and saying where is her hot dog! The waitress offers to make it all again but I decline. I did not want to wait another 20 minutes to get  our food but asked her to please come and sing happy birthday to the kids being it was the whole reason we came there in the first place. She apologized again and said she would be out to sing right away. As I am waiting at the table a manager then proceeds to come to that table to talk to me about replacing my meal. Didn\'t I just say that I didn\'t want to wait anymore that clearly this is not a good night for me to come here. He then offers for me to take a carryout. If I wanted to order a carryout. I would have. I don\'t want to take home food and save it for later. I\'m not a left over type. It just doesn\'t taste the same. He then says if I change my mind I can take home meals. In the mean time still no Happy Birthday! Why am I waiting so long for my kids to get a simple Happy Birthday! I would have already left. They finally come out to sing happy birthday and the waitress apologizes again. Now here is my biggest shocker! Do you know that I received the bill and NOTHING...I MEAN NOTHING WAS COMPENSATED! I was so pissed that I actually thought about just leaving a note that said ""how can you expect someone to pay for food they did not eat????"" However I did not.  I politely payed my bill and left a 20% tip as well. Never the less. I payed for all my food that was cleared from my table and we barely got to eat. So i guess because I didn\'t want a carryout....that meant I will pay for all the food I did not eat! I will not return to this location!'",,status,,2012-10-07 17:59:51,2,15,0

7854678793_10151180429363794,"b""Listen here. Today, (or yesterday since it's 12 o'clock) was my parent's wedding anniversay. My family and I went shopping earlier that day, so we were pretty tired. And my mom and I hadn't ate very much earlier that day because we were busy. And since it was their wedding anniversary, we wanted to go some place nice. So we decided to go to the district of tustin's red robin. (Since the other one closer to us shut down). Well, my dad put in his name and how many people we had (which was only 4) and we waited. And waited. And waited. Then some lady called someone else's name and party of whatever. Then another. Then another. We waited around 30 minutes. Yes, it was a busy night for red robin's, but that's no excuse. Because while we were waiting outside, a couple of two put down their name and five minutes later, they got a table. Then a group of five people came, put down their name and ten minutes later, they got a table. It wasn't until my mom complained to those ladies, that we got a table. So everything's all dandy now that we got a table, right? Wrong. Some nice lady, took our drink orders and went away. But then some other lady, who was obviously a newbie, wanted to get our drink order. We already ordered drinks. So instead she took our food orders. The same nice lady came and gave us our drinks. Then five minutes later, the same nice lady brought us fries. Now, I know that doesn't seem much, right? But by then, we were STARVING. That little act of good customer service, THAT'S what you guys need to learn from her. She turned our bad moods into good ones. Because before her, we recieved AWFUL attention. One of the worst, if not, the worst customer attention ever. Later that night, we found her name. Serena. Serena of the district of tustin's red robin. Remeber that name. She changed our dining mood that night. With those two baskets of fries. It's small details like that, that you guys need to work on. We've been to the market place's red robin all the time, before it closed down, because we got good customer service, and reasonably priced food. But you need to shape up, red robin. Or else you're going to lose customers for bad customer service. Because isn't it about the customer who orders your food, and pays hard earned money, to expect good service in return? Without Serena, we would've never come to any red robin's ever again. But because of her, in the future, we probably will come again. So the moral of this whole story: train your employees better in good customer service, or else they won't come back at all.""",,status,,2012-09-30 02:41:31,2,3,0

Lane (son) and I went there to grab dinner while Michelle Lane-Ogden (a/k/a: ""Mommy"") went to Giant Eagle. The place was jammed as there was some sort of classic car event out in their parking lot, so getting a table took some time. Then, once we had ordered and finally received our food Lane had to go to the bathroom; this itself is not a problem, but while we were in the bathroom the busboy (bus-person?) took our plates (neither meal was more than half consumed) despite the fact that Lane\'s ball cap and stuffed elephant were still sitting at the table (which would imply that we had not, in fact, left). We came back to our table to find the check waiting on us. The waiter offered to get us a dessert, which I had believed was compensation for the food which had been thrown away (he and I did discuss that point prior to the offer being made); this was not, in fact, the case as we got charged for the disposed entrees plus dessert and the manager was apparently unavailable for further discussion. By this point Michelle had returned from the shopping run and, rather than let the frozen groceries and dairy products spoil, I just paid up and we left. Definitely not a positive evening.'",,status,,2012-08-16 18:59:26,1,3,0

My best friends and I have been going to Red Robin Metrotown @ Station Square Mall for a long time and always have a good meal but Tonight we went and had the worst service! The Restaurant wasnt that busy in our opinion but the service and the kitchen espeically was soo unorganized. We could hear staff in the pass area talking overly loud and about random topics not about there orders. Our food took almost an hour to make 3 burgers and fries and the server kept forgetting things. He never asked us how our food was tasting and brought out or drinks by hand without using a proper tray and his hand nearly touching the rim of the glass. The One thing that really bothered me the most is after we finsihed the burgers he immediately brought us the bill without asking first if we wanted dessert. We come to red robin mostly because you have the best cheesecake of any chain restaurant and found that rude as we did want dessert!

He is bringing my son back in this Friday to celebrate his birthday again and feeding my family. My son is so happy. Since he has special needs, he does have depression and gets bullied. When ANYONE reaches out to do something kind for him, it means a lot. I know I would not experience this outstanding level of customer service from 95% of the resturaunt industry.

Both waitresses worked hard to keep up with our group of 20 which included 5 children under the age of 6.

Didnn't think anything of it and so she went to the bathroom and came back to the table crying and covered in puke. A child that was visiting Red Robin had thrown up in front of the thresh hold of the girls bathroom. Hannah didn't see it and slipped and fell right into the throw up, covering her all over. Red Robin said that they would pay for us to buy her a new outfit at big5 seeing how we were a long ways from home. After purchasing her a cute warm up set and a under armour shirt, Red Robin did in fact pay for her outfit to replace her clothing she was wearing at the time... then gave us a $40.00 gift card on top of it.

Every other Restaurant has ESPN on, please be different. For the majority of your customers don't really care about Football, Baseball, and Basketball. Please change your policy.

Before I had to stop  because I needed a drink. She assumed we were done becasue I was sitting there not eating...she brought me the check before I got my first drink refill. The resturaunt wasn\'t even full, if it were busy in there I would understand. This was just ridiculous. I had questions about the rewards card but I was so frustrated with my terrible service. I\'m always a generous tipper but Bianca did not earn one last night with service like that. Makes me and my family a little reluctant to want to come back.

Your food rocks & deserves the Zagat rating!  There's just no other burger as good as yours!  The Five Guys people I'm sure will switch over to you when they taste how good RR burgers are!  Now if you could just bring back the Chicken Milano!  Don't know when that disappeared off the menu, but was very disappointed you didn't have that when I went to the Santa Ana location last yr.!

I was there with my children for the first at this Red Robin, I usually frequent the other store in Nashville. After this evening, I can honestly say that I will ALWAYS go to this store!! My sons and I were sitting eating dinner. My son was somewhat down because Red Robin is his daddy's favorite restaurant and he could not be with us because he is currently serving the country in Afghanistan. Our server, Andrew, took great care of us while we were there. He sat and talked to my oldest son who is 5 and was wondering why he was so down. He explained that this is his dad's favorite place and he wasn't here. So then my youngest son, had to show him a picture and he said oh your daddy is a soldier. As we were finishing up our meal, the manager and several servers from the restaurant came to our table.

The ""manager"" in a beige shirt insisted that the burger got ""wrapped tight"" to cut in half, so that\'s why the bun and burger were miniscule.  When I compared the burger to the regular sized burger that my husband was eating, the manager still insisted in maintaining  his lies.
