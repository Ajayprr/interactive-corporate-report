The hostess sat us immediately and told us Chris (our server) would be with us. Our first impression of Chris was her reprimanding the hostess for seating her and not somebody else even though she seemed to only have 1 other table. Then she came up to the table with a very \xe2\x80\x9cdidn\xe2\x80\x99t wanna be there\xe2\x80\x9d type of demeanor and introduced herself. She grabbed our drink order and disappeared for about 5 minutes, saw us sitting there still drink-less and came out with our water and lemonade and said \xe2\x80\x9cdidn\xe2\x80\x99t forget about you, I\xe2\x80\x99m just slow today\xe2\x80\x9d (not sure if she meant business was slow or if she meant she was having a mentally off night), she asked if we were ready to order and we asked for another minute or two and she let us sit for another 10 minutes. She walked by us about a half a dozen times and didn\xe2\x80\x99t say a word. Finally came back and got our order and left the table. We sat for 45 minutes waiting for our food (Side salad, JD burger, & JD chicken sandwich) while we watched her continuously walk by us without her acknowledging us. Not even so much as a table touch and \xe2\x80\x9cit\xe2\x80\x99ll just be a few minutes\xe2\x80\x9d. We continued to sit, about 20 minutes into the 45 minutes we sat and waited for our food, we ran out of drinks. She didn\xe2\x80\x99t even bring a refill even though she passed us multiple times. We ended up leaving the $3 for the lemonade and walking out. We would have gotten better customer service from the Burger King kiosk inside the mall. I felt bad for doing that but considering there weren\xe2\x80\x99t many tables and everyone around us had their food already, I don\xe2\x80\x99t see the reason why we sat for 45 minutes without food or drinks while we watched her only other table get their food, put in a drink order, get their drink, put in a dessert order, and get their dessert before I even had my first refill. \n\nHorrible experience. Will not be returning.

She came back to the table to tell me her manager would cook me a few more ribs because I was not happy with my order.  She also informed me he was coming out to talk to me. The restaurant was understaff so I had to ask the waitress where was my ribs?  She said oh, I thought they brought them out. I told her to forget it just bring us the ticket.  She express how sorry she was and that the manager would come out and talk with me.  I told her that's the second time she said that and he hasn't come out yet.  My husband informed me his food was not good either.  We have been to TGIF many times but was really disappointed in the service and the food.  You could tell a lot of other customers felt the same way we did.   We don't eat out a lot because I am a family of 5 and the cost can get expensive, but when I do I don't like giving my money away.

They cancelled our drinks knowing we were finished and still waited 30 minutes for our bill. It was the worst experience ever and unprofessional to have a holiday party in front of customers. The waitress we had kept putting blame on the bartender and cook. I'm very disappointed with this service and can't see myself ever going back to that location. I've never had a problem at the one in Rockford and love the brand but I'm so upset about today's service. There was barely any customers and we still had the worst service.

She took our drink order and didn\xe2\x80\x99t come back for another 15 minutes. We ordered our food - both my husband and I ordered endless apps and my husband ordered the bacon cheeses burger which we used our rewards points on. We waited 25 minutes for our food to come out. My first order of endless apps was wrong - so she finally brought out what I ordered. After that we had to wait 20 mins for each app we ordered after being told we couldn\xe2\x80\x99t order what we wanted next until we were done. We spent over 2 hours with 2 babies for some appetizers. Our mozzarella sticks came out cold and cheeseless.

I ordered the Jack Daniel\'s chicken, with a side of mashed potatoes and a side of tomato mozzarella salad. After arriving home, I opened up the bag and removed the lid from the salad container. The attached image is of the salad I received. Before taking this picture, I did not eat any of it. That\'s all they gave me! How does a spoonfull of food constitute a side order portion?! Additionally, the chicken was way overcooked to the point that it was hard and rubbery, and I could not eat it. I\'m definitely not a picky eater. I tried to give it to my dog, but he didn\'t even eat it. He spit most of it back out because he couldn\'t chew it, and he eats ANYTHING! After spending almost $40 + a tip for the bartender who handed me my order, all l I had for dinner was a side of mashed potatoes. I called the restaurant to speak to a manager. The girl who answered used the phrase ""what do you want"" and proceeded put me on hold for over 5 minutes. I hung up and called back. After identifying myself, I was put on hold again. The phone just rang and rang, and I wasn\'t able to reach anyone.

After a long day at Universal Studios we solely chose to dine at Friday\'s so the staff could sing happy birthday  to her. After eating our dinner I asked the waitress if she could get a piece of cake and few staff members to come sing for my daughter as you usually would. The waitress kindly informed me that they are not allowed to sing or give out cakes but that I could purchase my own cake and sing to her ourselves. After going back and forth about the cake selection the waitress said she could put a candle in a scoop of ice cream. Seeing as there wasn\'t any other option I agreed. The waitress comes back stating there was no candles.. This was the outcome, the waitress holding a lighter in front of a bowl if ice cream. I\'ll give it to the waitress for trying to be creative.

107696493204_10210717950197524,"b'I want to take just a couple minutes of your time and bring your attention to the gentleman in the red shirt below. My boyfriend and I decide to go out to dinner (like we normally do almost every other weekend or so). Well that nights choice for restaurants was TGI Friday\'s here in Anchorage, Alaska. Anyways so we go in and are instantly greeted by a wonderful crew of people. After just a couple minutes of sitting down me and my boyfriend notice this Guy in the red shirt just walking all over the place. After a couple of minutes of watching him we figured out that he had to be the manager of the place. After we made that conclusion we thought ""oh he\'s probably just out for a couple minutes to see how everything is and then he\'ll go back to his office and hide."" Boy were we TOTALLY WRONG!! Not only was he out on the floor for the hour and half we were there but he also did so many things. He was constantly helping his crew with things like serving people, taking plates away, seeing if you need anything, getting drinks, and even (gasp) cleaning and wiping down tables. There were also many times he went into the kitchen and I can only imagine what he was helping his chefs with back there. Anyways the point of this post is to bring to light what an amazing Manager this gentleman is. We live in a world were most people when they get promoted or move up they forget where they came from and thank that they are better/above there employees. But not this guy, he truly shined that night when we were there, not because he is better then his crew/employees but for the exact opposite! He was doing everything that he expects his employees to do, and he did them right along side with them. That my friends is a TRUE MANAGER!! Please if you stop in to TGI Friday\'s in Anchorage give this man a hand shake and a pat on the back for not letting his title as manager go to his head and for all his hard work. \n\nThank you again Dyan (that\'s the red shirt manager) for the best dining experience I have ever. I will definitely be coming back!'",,photo,https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10210717950197524&set=o.107696493204&type=3,2017-01-25 19:41:57,0,1,0

Firstly.. the Jack Daniel's Flat Iron has been replaced by the sirloin... while the sirloin is a bigger cut of meat (not to mention a bigger price) the quality is way worse (as can be seen in the picture of rubbery non edible steak). Next, the parmesan steak fries were taken off the menu.. no biggie since I found we can order the seasoned fries with a side of parmesan garlic sauce.... well, when I ordered my side of sauce, I was given a cup of a some oily, disgusting mess (again a picture is enclosed).. What I'm trying to say is after six years of great, yummy date nights, I'm heartbroken to say this was our last Friday's visit..

The person attending us would not accept the valid temporary NYS drivers license, even though I showed her another valid picture ID. She became very rude and increasingly hostile toward me. I started to record the situation and asked her for her name so that I could go to the GM and explain how rude she was being to the management. As I asked her for her name she smacked and scratched me on the face and almost knocked my phone out of my hand.  I called the police and made a report of assault.  When I finally spoke to the manager, they made light of the situation as if it was nothing.  As I was outside, I asked a crew member what her name was and he told me it was Mary. I am not sure if she was being racist against my skin color or disapproving of my gay lifestyle, but I am very upset and demand that someone from the company contact me and resolve this issue or I will go to the press and highlight how your company does not care about its customers.\n#TGIFRIDAYS #lowerManhattanTGIFRIDAYS\n#TGIF #HappyHour #NotSoHappyHour\n#StopTheViolence \n#AntiViolenceProject \n#LGBTQ'",,video,https://www.facebook.com/jeff.manrique.37/videos/625010820994366/,2016-10-04 18:01:37,5,81,4

107696493204_1129937113739661,"b""I apologize resorting to this, but I tried 3 other ways of contacting someone regarding our service tonight at Friday's. \n\n   I want to start by saying, our waitress Madison, was very friendly and she cannot be held solely responsible for our terrible experience. \n\n  My husband and I received a gift card as a gift for dog sitting. We generally do not come to Friday's but was excited to have a nice dinner. Or so we thought. \n\n  My husband ordered the turkey burger which we come to find out was no longer on the menu. Bummer. So he ordered something else along with an app. I ordered the salmon with lobster and requested no Alfredo sauce since I'm lactose intolerant. I still wanted mushrooms, so Madison explained I could get mushrooms, they would just be cooked separately. Totally cool. My sides were broccoli and a salad. I also added a side of 5 shrimp. \n\n   When our app came, it was great. However when our food arrived, we were so disappointed. No salad, no mushrooms and no shrimp! To boot, the portion I received was pitiful. They should be ashamed to send this out for $17. I took a photo which I attached below.\n\n   Madison retrieved everything I was missing and apologized. She did not charge me for the shrimp because of the mistake. I was so hungry I ate my food, and we asked for the bill. \n\n  When the bill came I saw that she charged me for the mushroom. Which was a surprise to me, considering if I wasn't lactose intolerant they would have come free. Then I notice I'm charged for a 3rd rum and coke from the bar in which I did not have. I only drank 2. I brought it to her attention and she took it off stating that there had been 3 because someone knocked my 2nd out of her hand on the way to our table and she forgot to remove it. That could explain why it took so long to receive. \n\n   I understand it was a busy Friday night but as you'll see below, the standards are clearly under expectations and Friday's really needs to take a look at what the kitchen is serving people (especially for the high prices you have!)""",,photo,https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=1129937113739661&set=o.107696493204&type=3,2016-09-09 18:49:51,6,13,0

Way to go, getting unsuspecting people to pay more in tips by putting an inflated number on your receipts. And before you say the total is based on the entire cost of the meal before discounts, you are the one's running a $10 endless app deal.

107696493204_4155577329968,"b'Dear Fridays,\n\nI want to tell you about the amazing cajun chicken pasta I had for dinner tonight. \n\nI want to, but I can\'t.\n\nYou might be wondering why. You see, I tried to go to dinner tonight with my fiance at the Friday\'s on Anton Blvd in Costa Mesa, California. I don\'t know if you live near, or have ever been in, southern California, but the weather is wonderful. It was 73 degrees this evening around 8:30.\n\nWe wanted to have dinner on the patio. When we got there, we waited a couple minutes -- not an unreasonable amount of time, but a short while (this will become relevant in a moment) -- to see a hostess. When we requested outdoor seating, we were told that there was no outdoor seating available because the space was too tight for the server to fit through as there was a large party seated there. \n\nWe were told that we had the option to ""wait for a table, I guess... but it will probably be a while..."" I don\'t know if she was tired, or bored, or just didn\'t want us to choose to do that, but it sounded like she didn\'t really want us to take her up on it. \n\nWe looked at each other, confused, because we had seen a likely looking table when we walked passed the patio. We mentioned there was a table that didn\'t seem restricted, but the hostess hadn\'t bothered to actually check -- and she repeated that there was no available seating outside.\n\nAs we walked out, I wondered why the hostess hadn\'t even bothered to check. My fiance and I stopped and looked at each other, wondering what to do, as we stared at the empty table in the far corner that I had been eyeing on the way in, which was in no way blocked or cramped by the large party. \n\nWe debated going back in and asking for the table in the corner, the one that was next to the door, that had the same access and room around it as every other time we\'ve ever been to Fridays when no large party was present, that didn\'t require squeezing by any parties, large or otherwise, but ultimately decided that we didn\'t want to tell the hostess how to do her job and potentially risk frosty service.  \n\nWe both felt it was a really awkward position to put potential customers in, telling us that something was not available when it was obvious that A, it was, B, the hostess had no way to know if that was true as tables leave all the time and the front was empty when we arrived, and C, she didn\'t bother to check.\n\nThe next time I want to pay $15 for pasta I guess we\'ll just go to the cheesecake factory.\n\nSincerely, \n\nA very disappointed woman who ate a burger for dinner'",,photo,https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=4155577329968&set=o.107696493204&type=3,2016-08-29 01:00:14,1,1,0

I got a quick response and a request to send them a private message, which I did. This past Tuesday I got a call back from their Guest Relations team. I told them about my experience and was assured that I would receive a call from a Director level person the next day that would resolve this issue. On Thursday I still did not hear from anyone, so I decided to send another private Facebook message and again I got a quick response, where they assured me that someone from their Guest Relations team would ""be in touch with me soon.""  Not until Friday afternoon did I receive a call from a nice woman who said that she was ""prioritizing my case"" and that the ""Director of Operations"" would be in contact with me shortly. She said that they would be the ones who could best provide me with a resolution.  I asked repeatedly what she meant by that, but was not given a straight answer. Well I\'m still waiting...

107696493204_1107811919290978,"b""Friday night I went out to eat in celebration of my sister's High School graduation. We ate at T.G.I Friday's in Green Acres Mall and our waiter was nothing less than amazing. He took the large order for our drinks, appetizers and lastly our meals in that order since we were a large party. Everything came quickly but our drinks took forever. When they finally came, one of the alcoholic beverages were too dark as if a darker liquid fell into it but our amazing waiter fixed it with no problem. The rest of dinner was great until I got a little further into drinking my mango passion smoothie and realized there was a piece of bacon in my drink, at least that's what I thought it was. After further analyzing it we came to the conclusion that it was a band-aid. \nAfter speaking to the manager he told me that he checked in with the barista and that the band-aid never came into direct contact with his skin or the actual cut. He explained to me that the actual cut was on his finger which was covered by a band-aid, a finger cot and a glove in that order. He said that the barista chose to put an extra band-aid on the outside of the glove to keep the original band-aid in place, which doesn't make any sense. Eventually I asked to see the barista's hand for myself and they escorted me to go look. They told me he was in the bathroom but as I was standing there I noticed that none of the employees behind the counter working the bar didn't have any gloves on their hands. He then came back to me 2 minutes later to say that he was no longer in the building because his shift was over at 4pm yet it was minutes until 5pm. Eventually the Assistant General Manager came out and spoke with me but I was never able to actually see his hand myself. This is very unsanitary and unacceptable. I filled out a store complaint and was told I would get a phone call within 24-48 hours it's now Tuesday and I haven't received any phone calls from anyone. I have the risk of catching Hepatitis C and no one has called me yet about this incident. I'm currently at the doctor waiting to get blood work done because of this bandaid I found. I should be at work right now and I can't be there because of negligence and unprofessionalism.""",,photo,https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=1107811919290978&set=o.107696493204&type=3,2016-06-28 10:27:20,0,2,0

Service was absolutely fantastic and will definitely be visiting again as food was outstanding. But the main reason I am writing this, is related to the gratitude we felt. My boyfriend was still wearing his Cancer Research shirt and our waiter asked why. So we explained what had happened. When our bill came at the end of the meal, we were surprised to see a message on the front of our folded receipt. The waiter deducted 25% from our bill and told us to put it towards Cancer Research. This was a brilliant gesture of goodwill.

As anyone who's been to TGI's knows it's loud and busy and for any autistic person it's a sensory overload waiting to happen I was weary of taking Lucy but I decided to try . I requested at table by the window on my booking knowing it was better for Lucy , I crossed my fingers and off we went we arrived and as requested we had a table by the window , good start now time to see how Lucy handles it . The next thing I know we are greeted by our waitress Lara . Not only did she engage with Lucy , but for the first time in a long while Lucy had a conversation with a complete stranger!  yes it was about a burger but there was eye contact and Lucy was Lucy not mirroring some thing she had seen .She knelt next to the table to take our order , for those of you that no Lucy she struggles with people looming above her and starts to panic . I don't even think Lara knew what she had done, she brought Lucy stickers and got Jacob and Lucy laughing and giggling .  She made the whole visit a pleasurable one  and I even stopped watching Lucy for signs of a meltdown . And I spent time on a night out chatting with Jacob this never happens and as Lucy's brother he is used to and happy to put Lucy first but tonight we had a good chat .

Also my food was cold but after two other individuals at my table sending their food back I didn't bother and just asked for a container to take my food with me.  What I actually wanted to eat I was told it was no longer available for the night.  I was very disappointed in my first visit to this new location.""",b'TGI Fridays',link,https://www.facebook.com/TGIFridays/,2016-05-10 23:51:35,0,1,0

Net, we found a hair in our salad, the manager never apologized and we were charged for the ""hairy"" salad. Below my comment to the restaurant in Spanish, so please you can forward to them:\n\n""Acabamos de tener una desagradable experiencia en Friday\'s del Boulevard Moraz\xc3\xa1n.

We sat in the bar area at one of the high tops. The hostess came over to let us know our server would be over shortly.  Within a few moments he came over. We asked for three waters and three beers. The waters came immediately. 30 minutes later the beers came.  We soon realized that our waiter was taking care of the entire bar area and the bar tender was taking care of peope at the bar.  So we moved to the bar thinking the service would be better.  So we placed our order. Avis Criss Gordon ordered the Sizzlin Chicken, Tyrone ordered the Cheeseburger and I ordered the Chicken Tenders.  40 minutes later our food arrived. The French Fries were cold and the Tenders were under cooked and the Sizzling Chicken had sizzled out, burned, and cold. When I brought this to the bar tenders attention his response was i didn't cook it nor did i serve it, I just took your order.  WHAT??? We couldn't believe what we had just heard and witnessed. The MOD came over and apologize and attempt to make things right by taking care our meal. Just know We will Never Ever step foot in another TGI Fridays.""",,photo,https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10208874845489669&set=o.107696493204&type=3,2016-04-16 11:57:13,4,13,2

I am highly dissapointed that it only states in the terms and conditions state that it is only not valid in Northern Ireland but says nothing about Scotland but we were refused the use of the offers in the app in store. I feel that this is very miss leading to the consumer and wonder how many other patrons have been refused the offer when the terms and conditions clearly state that it is only Northern Ireland that it does not appy to. Not only this but when our paid for appetiser arrived there were no forks to eat it with and we had to wait 5 minutes before a waitress would come over and give us 2 forks so we could share the appetiser while it was going cold.\n\nWe both have been avid fans of TGI Fridays for years and have spent a small fortune in your various stores accross the UK but this visit has left a particularly bitter taste in our mouths.\n\nKind regards\n\nStuart',,photo,https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10205944016267565&set=o.107696493204&type=3,2016-03-27 14:03:55,6,14,0

They just kept chatting. Then they argued who would get the phone instead of assist the guest lining up. There were only 4-6 tables full in the whole restaurant and when I said I needed a table for 1 they said oh it will be 5-10 minute wait. When I asked why they said we don't have enough servers. They suggested that I go to the bar which I explained I couldn't sit at the bar stools since I am 9 months pregnant. They just laughed and started talking about how crazy that was. Stood there for 20 minutes and they seated people who came in after me. When I asked how much longer it was going to take they seated me right away. First the hostss took me to a table and the other hostess came up to her and said no not there, the other table which was all the way on the opposite side of the restaurant. Sat down, waited 5-10 minutes for my server to come. I ordered a water and then the appetizer where you pick 3 of the choices. When it came out my wings weren't fully done and the cheese sticks were over cooked to where all the cheese exploded out of them. There was absolutely no manager on the floor to take any complaints. It was ridiculous. I used to work at a Fridays, I don't know if the policy has changed to where you have to have a manager on the floor or if the hostesses don't have to greet people anymore but I dont think I will ever go to Fridays again.""",,photo,https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=805810542862056&set=o.107696493204&type=3,2015-12-14 16:41:00,6,1,0

Now, the restaurant was not full.  There was even a separate section where the tables could have been pushed together, but allegedly there were not enough waiters/waitresses.  We were told that if we wanted to be seated that our party would need to be split up, which was unacceptable.  Following a few phone calls we found a restaurant that would take us right away.  Shame on you Friday's, because this is the tab that you missed out on, and I'm sure that there were some servers that would have loved to have gotten the tip on this bill.""",,photo,https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10207063334274750&set=o.107696493204&type=3,2015-12-13 22:54:42,72,24,0

Our server finally came to our table, he was so fast that if my boyfriend hadn\'t stopped him he would have already walked away without our app order. After waiting for a good 15 min on nachos the plate came out. What a sad excuse for a nacho that has ever been seen on earth. Hard taco shells cut it half with refried beans and I guess you could say there was beef on there, with shredded cheese that was microwaved on. I could have made better nachos out of dog food. Thankfully our entr\xc3\xa9es came out right after we finished our food, but I think that\'s because it had been sitting in the window in the kitchen the entire time. I asked for my burger to be pink in the middle, it was well done. And cold. And  fries tasted like they were from this morning. What really cracked me up was when our server placed the dessert menu on our table and said ""just in case"". Ha.

We are asking that employees be dismissed immediately for these actions! A public restaurant is not an appropriate place to push a racist and violent agenda towards LEOs or Veterans. We have drafted a list of chains with their FB pages that need to be contacted by as MANY people as possible. We have also, drafted a cover letter to copy and paste on their FB pages to make this as easy as possible. If there are others that we have missed please feel free to contact them as well and post the letter to their FB page.

Unfortunately, in recent weeks, we have become aware of Employees and Management of many 'fast food' stores disrespecting Police Officers and Veterans in uniform by writing notes on food packaging and verbally refusing service to Police Officers and Veterans while on duty and in uniform. In addition, your attorneys should brief you on the Law Enforcement Officers Safety Act, which in effect, allows an on-duty officer to open carry in any place that it is not prohibited or restricted on government property. All your employees should be made aware of this law! As Americans, and Veterans, we stand with millions of Americans who see this behavior as unacceptable! We are requesting that all fast food and dine in chains send memos to all store Managers, Employees and Franchise Owners, and adopt a company policy of immediate dismissal of any Employee found to have committed this discrimination or harassment. Our goal, is only to get cooperation, but as we have seen, such incidents can lead to Boycotts and Nationwide outrage. We would like to think that the customers who support your business are ALL important to you. Those who put their lives on the line for our safety and freedom deserve respect from all who live under the veil of their bravery and sacrifice. We are requesting a response to let us know that you have addressed this issue, and that your employees have been informed of your policy, or change in policy...Thank you Sincerely for your cooperation in this matter.\n Your Customers""",b'Red Lobster',link,https://www.facebook.com/redlobster/,2015-10-18 14:03:42,1,1,0

107696493204_1629216700661670,"b'I dont know where to begin on describing my most unpleasant visit to T.G.I. Friday\'s. Yesterday, I went with a work group to go to a Friday\'s that we regularly frequent. It began when the waitress was told that we had FREE Appetizer coupons. That\'s when she told us it\'d be $8.00 off of an appetizer....the coupon said FREE....but we didn\'t argue and just tried to use the coupons to the most. When I realized my appetizer wouldn\'t be free I asked about the Endless Appetizer which runs $12/$13. The waitress told me that if I were to order that, $8.00 would be taken off the regular price of the first one and afterwards I would be charged the normal price for each refill/order. Of course that didn\'t make sense to me if the Endless appetizer promo is only $12/$13. So I didn\'t dwell on that and decided to go with the Take 3 another appetizer deal. Since I am allergic to pork, I asked if I could get mozzarella sticks and double wings. She then told me that I would not be able to double. Then she said certain pork made dishes could be altered to not have the pork in it. However, to avoid an allergic reaction to this insult being called ""service"",  I just ordered a Caesar salad and some wings. As I waited forever for my food, I sipped my beverage down and hoped to be topped off but to no avail, I was sipping melted ice. Then I noticed the group I was with who ordered well done steaks, burgers, and meals that take longer to cook than mine all got their meals before me! I was the last to get my burnt, tiger-striped, dry wings and salad with rotten lettuce. There was literally lettuce in my Caesar salad that was whitish-brown. datbglaze@gmail.com'",,photo,https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=1629216700661670&set=o.107696493204&type=3,2015-10-17 14:29:20,0,1,0

It\'s frustrating when you see people you love risking their lives for others and then be treated in this manner.  Whether or not your establishment supports our men and women in blue, some of your employees do not. I can speak for many LEO families when I say we don\'t visit where we aren\'t welcome.'",,photo,https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10102311944496902&set=o.107696493204&type=3,2015-10-07 15:09:07,4,5,0

The fact is, that this was the manager and employees preference that made it happen. A responsible manager, if bold enough to ask the officers to leave, should have simply asked for proper identification.

We ordered dinner at 5:55. We each got the Jack D sirloin and i paired mine with Jack ribs.\n\nAt 6:35, our meals finally showed up. Our medium steaks were between Medium -well and over -well-done. 30 seconds after we got the plates, one of the three bartenders taking care of us checked on us. That's  when we cut into the shoe leather that used to be steaks. The individual offered to have them recooked but we were extremely hungry and didnt want to wait another half hour. He offered to tell the manager. \n\nShe showed up a few minutes later. She offered to take the costs of the indvidual steaks off of our bill and send us home with desserts.\n\nThat was nice, but we were already going to be using a BOGO entree coupon, so what savings was there for us when she told us to keep that coupon because we would probably be saving more with the discounted steaks? (Note : we did... by about 3 cents). \n\nI sent my wife home after we ordered our takeout desserts at 7pm. I was finally able to leave at 730 after i finally received the desserts and the adjusted check. I also noticied that our 2 non alcoholic drinks and appetizer were removed from the check as well. That was appreciated. \n\nThat being said, I'm not looking for anything in compensation.  I want to point out the long wait we had for dinner as well as the half hour inhad to wait for the desserts that were supposed to be a compensation themselves for a long wait and poor food quality. Why wasnt more emphasis placed on making sure my table was better taken care of after having already suffered? \n\nThe final straw was when we opened my wifes dessert ... the salted caramel dessert. See the attached picture ... it is sitting in  a 6x6 box ... it looks positively miniscule.\n\nWe have had very few bad experiences at this location. This might have been our first one. However,  attention needed to be called to it.""",,photo,https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10153144782866958&set=o.107696493204&type=3,2015-09-05 15:03:27,0,3,0

My cousin who just moved from PR to Florida wanted to visit your restaurant, so we went. We waited over 30 minutes to sit when there were plenty of tables available.  I asked the host what was taking so long and she said to have a seat because other people were in front of me. We then waited for over 15 minutes to have someone come and serve us our drinks and this is not  counting the time it took to even get a waiter. When we get our drinks, they forget to bring my husband\'s beer. We order our meal and when we finally got our meals it had been over an hour. The food was warm,  and the orders were messed up. We finally called the manager because we were so hungry and they wanted to take my cousin\'s meal so they can ""fix it"". They gave her ribs instead of a steak.  The manager fixed the meals but didn\'t even discounted us for the inconvenience. Between our party we paid over  $130 for the worst experience ever.  Even though I was upset I still tipped the waitress but needless to say won\'t be visiting your restaurant for a while. Not a good first impression for my cousin who had heard so many wonderful things about your restaurant.

We sat down, Will is our server and we start with a soda with no ice and water with lemon. We got soda with ice and water no lemon. After 15 minutes and the server Will making excuses why they didn't have lemons, I went to the bar and got my own lemon. 10 more minute we left cause the server Will still had not brought lemons for the water. Maybe cause he was to busy watching the game on the TV. Then when we went to the host to tell them to cancel our order, Will came over and still insisted that they were still cutting lemons. Worst service ever and probably won't be going back. And on top of it all endless apps have ended. But endless lobster biscuits will never end. #FridaysSuck and not talking about the day of the week.\nPaul saved the day at Red Lobster we got our food faster then we got lemons at Friday's.

107696493204_905762692780539,"b'Today my other half and I stopped at your concord nh location. Which I might add we often do. Today was the worst experience I have ever had in any restaurant. Our waitress was very slow and confused, she placed our order as well as other customers orders around us wronge. She did apologise, however, when we received our appetizer we had no plates or utensils. After trying to get her attention several times she finally came over. I asked for plates and utensils, she brought us 2 plates and 2 sets of utensils, even,though we had our 1 year old daughter with us. Every time food or drinks where delivered to the table it was put within reach of our daughter (compromising her safety with hot food ). Even,after all this when our meals where delivered they where wronge, we sent them back. When they came out a second time , mine was suppose to be the jack daniels rib eye cooked medium with mashed and broccoli. The stake was more then well done and mashed potatoes where cold and inedible. His all American burger was so salty he could not eat it. My daughters food was stone cold. Part way tgrough eating my rubber stake i found human hair on it. I immediately asked the waitress for the manager because I was honestly furious by this point. I was told a manager was unavailable. The pictures of the food and table where taken right before we left. None of us could stomach the food. I was astonished that when we received our bill we where expected to pay for it all. Im sorry but if you value your reputation as a business you need to get someone in there that is capable of running a restaurant. Someone who will take care of your customers, as a business owner myself I would be appalled if this was how my employees where running things, not only comprising the health and well being but down right just not caring. P.s the ribs you see are part of the first order they made the mistake on. I asked her to remive them from my table, she didnt. So when i realised how terrible my meal was i tried one, and it was the consistency of saw dust.... Hope this helps you fix one of my favorite restaurants in the area'",,photo,https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=905762692780539&set=o.107696493204&type=3,2015-04-04 15:57:21,4,5,0

Once finished, I then had to wait 19 minutes for the server to come by and check on us. At this point we asked for water and he only brought one glass ( we are a party of two) second class comes and its a broken glass. We told the manager and they comped the dessert but I rather wished I would have not dined there. Then, we get the check and the server is around us fixing tables and doesn't come to get it.

I told myself I would NEVER go back and stayed true to my word until I came downtown Memphis today for a conference. My first issue with my visit today was the very terrible lack of customer service and one server assigned to a table with 10 people. It took literally 30 minutes to get WATERS that we ordered with lemon. Then another hour to get FOOD! Ok I understand it will take a little longer to get food with a larger table but when I wait an hour and the food comes out COLD something is NOT right about that!! One of my sisters and I ordered chicken tenders for the meal with salads and a side. To start, my chicken tenders compared to my sisters tenders looked microwaved! While hers were fried! I ate a piece of the tip from the chicken tenders before ripping it open and noticing that my chicken tenders were RAW! Straight RAW! I could not believe it. (btw my sisters tenders were still frozen inside.) Anyways, I was so disgusted and shocked! What made it worse is that no manager or anyone else came to the table to apologize and try to make it right. The server brought me a ticket and said ""they took the tenders off, now only the drink is on there."" I was not paying for ANYTHING! Don\'t give me raw food and then try to bill me for anything!! That is Crazy!! This is the second time this has happened to me. Second time is a charm because I will NOT be back!! I will write reviews everywhere. Word of mouth is everything. Oh and did I mention that when I went into the bathroom I had to ask for soap and paper towels?!

A little while later the manager came back with a 25.00 gift certificate and said they had raised money before Christmas to give to the military folks...and she thanked us for our service...I said ""But we are Canadian military"" to which she came back with....""you are military"". Tell me that is not the coolest thing ever!! They totally made made my day...and if it hadn\'t been for Pierre-Luc teasing me...I may have shed a tear.....my pride in being military rang strong today. So if you are ever near this airport please stop in at the TGI Fridays near gate 30... Store 0807 and have a drink...or a bite to eat....they deserve your business!!

The waiter took our orders, but not the menus, and 35 minutes later our appetizers arrived. There was no soy sauce for the pot stickers, but I could manage. Now it was time for the main course... Of the 9 meals ordered, 3 came out correct. \n\nMy broccoli was on the plate, but in a plastic bag. You know how it is, some places are all about the presentation. We still haven\'t received the shipping confirmation on Alicia\'s fries, but the waiter was kind enough to offer to remove the undelivered fries and Steve\'s undelivered beer from the check. I guess we all know what happened at this point with our dessert order.\n\nThis was all of course before he decided to head home for the night. Once realizing he left the manager took over. I did feel bad for the guy with every table complaining, but splitting our tables bill and taking $40 off of $200 worth of food wasn\'t enough. \n\nPoint of the story...

The first batch came out 1.5 potato skins later I found a 1 inch long blue rubberband in it. The wait staff promptly took the plate away and within a few minutes were out with another one. The waiter was very apologetic which was nice. I decided to use a fork and knife to eat the next one to pick through for a rubberband. This time I found a hunk of mystery meat that was still raw. The waiter came over immediately and grabbed the manager. The manager quickly took the piece of meat and went into the kitchen with it. He came back out and said he really had no idea what it was. I said it looks like pork or dark meat chicken. He said it looks like pork to him. I explained to him that for religious reasons I can't eat pork. He said no no no its chicken let me double check. He came back out and basically said it's not really our problem because we just have everything shipped to us and we heat it up. They took it off the bill and I had to ask for a sprite for free. the manager never came back out and the waiter still super apologetic admitted that they were pretty sure it was pork. I was up most of the night with severe stomach pain and nausea. I will never ever go back to any location.""",,photo,https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10152875902789197&set=o.107696493204&type=3,2014-12-07 11:38:15,0,1,0

First off, the restaurant was practically empty and we were being told we had to wait 15 minutes for a table that wasn\'t even that clean was off putting.  Half the tables were empty.  I asked the hostess why we had to wait and the reason was that ""there were no servers"".  At 5 PM with not enough servers was pathetic.  It is dinner time.  Our server was a whole different story.  I had my glass from my first drink stay on the table from the time it was finished until after we got our check.  It sat there empty all dinner and dessert.  Even after receiving a new drink the old glass was never removed.  Poor service all around.  I was told I couldn\'t substitute a side for my meal.  While a different server said it was totally possible.  I am attaching my appetizer that we purchased.  Potato skins with bacon.  There was no bacon and they didn\'t taste good at all.

The skins we were told is a new recipe. Seriously? Looks like a DIY fail. We got good service otherwise and part comped which we did not ask for but what I am asking is you look at this pictures. The failure, the sad seasoned fries that look more like what my 6 year old would try to do. Please go back to how you were. We are simply not going to another TGI Fridays until we hear it's better.

Told my server Joshua that I want that! He says ""sizzling chicken and shrimp- got it!"" It comes out 40 minutes later- looks nothing like the picture on the first page! I told him I didn\'t want it- forget an order for me. The manager comes out and says the picture is very deceiving because it is ""during the cooking process"" and shows me a picture further in that looked kinda what they brought out. I told her no way could I eat it with the cheese and tomato sauce. She says she will have them make it look exactly like the picture (to take home so I didn\'t hold up my family that have already finished their meals). I thank her and waited another 15-20 minutes. When I get home, this is what I got. I\'m so disappointed! I\'ve never had a bad meal at ANY TGIFridays. This one just turned me off your chain for good!

First, I had a stripes reward to use.  It was late and I forgot to tell the waitress before ordering.  I got the 2 for $16 deal and my son got new york bacon burger.  I remembered the reward and got her attention and told her.  She said ""You can\'t use that on 2 for 16"".  Since i had just placed my order, i asked if i could change it, she said ""NO"" and it seemed she was trying NOT to accommodate me.  I then asked if I could use it for my son\'s meal.  She said ""No because it would have had to be rung up on separate tickets.""   I told her to ring it up separate and she finally complied. \n ATTITUDE MUCH?  \n\nThen, when my son was ALMOST done eating....he had a few fries left and a waitress walking by grabbed his plate and took the rest of his fries without asking if he was done.\n\nThe final straw came when I took a bite of my sandwich and it literally tasted like feces.  I spit it right back out while trying not to vomit at the taste in my mouth.  \n\nThe only positive thing I can say is that the cost of the sandwich was taken off my bill.

That level of inconsistency is annoying when you're trying to follow the rules. \n2. They had run out of boneless buffalo wings. When I confronted the manager, he admitted that he had run out and had to substitute with 'a non-TGI Friday's product'. We don't even know what we've been eating! He apologized and said that he had been wiped out of stock by a team of Marist athletes. Instead of taking them off the menu, he made the switch without informing his patrons. He didn't even offer to absorb the cost given his deception.

We asked our server about the deal, since it was not on any menu, it took her ten minutes to hunt down a ""menu"" which is posted below. It upsets me to know that your company does not want us to know about your specials and specifically tell your servers not to mention it (see number 4).Then you go on to tell them that if the customer does know about the special then make sure you know what is on that menu.(see number 5). Why not just include it in the normal menu? Or perhaps a flyer placed on table? Its better than having a special that is only available to the lucky few that happened to see the commercial.I love TGIFridays. My sister would bring me there every weekend before she passed away, and my memories there were always fun, but this leaves a sour taste in my mouth.

The manager came to our table and was defending staff not listening to the customers and saying ""I\'ve known this server for a while and he wouldn\'t say anything like that."" The manager was also leaning up against the wall and rolling his eyes not helping or trying to offer solutions.

We sat in the restaurant and called the 1-888-284-5544 (back of gift card number) and they could only tell us the STORE ID where the card was used (which was useless because she couldn\'t tell me where the location was).  \n\nThe manager at the KOP location was completely useless...thankfully his waiter was a little more caring and at least attempted to help us.

We waited forever for service, then when I inquired about foods that didn't have soy/dairy due to an allergy in my daughter, who I breastfeed, I was treated as though I were insane for even asking a question like that. I was never offered a menu with allergy information, the waitress never even offered to go ask the cooks about the foods I was questioning, she just said she wasn't sure if the foods had soy/dairy. I ordered the pretzels because I thought they may be safe, but they came out with what appeared to be butter all over them. It took me another 15 minutes to get the waitresses attention to ask her if they could make me the pretzels without the butter, another 15 minutes later the pretzels were brought to me but by this time everyone in my party was done eating and my appetite was fading away. I ate the pretzels and they were okay, but my daughter was up sick all night with a tummy ache/diarrhea so apparently the preztels were not safe. I did not appreaciate this e-mail, the typo was the icing on the cake. The person did not even acknowledge my complaints or even appologize. I used to go to your restaurants for happy hour before I was a mother but I will not be returning.

However, we went there last night for my birthday dinner and I was somewhat disappointed. We've always had good meals, hot & fresh food, just always enjoyed it. But last night, when I received my normal sizzling chicken and cheese, the mashed potatoes were ice cold. I said something, and yes, they brought me new, hot potatoes. And then I started eating the chicken and it was quite tough and not juicy or fresh at all. I know, I could have just complained last night, but it was my birthday, and I'm dealing with one of my kids having been in the hospital for the past 5+ weeks, so I just wasn't in the mood. I'm sure we'll go back, because my kids still like the restaurant. I still wanted to say something, because it bummed me out after I thought about it more.

Our server was inattentive, and when we tried to call him over at one point to ask whether our chips and salsa was coming out soon (we had been waiting thirty minutes at this point) he actually acknowledged us, started to approach us, then turned around and walked away for an extended time.  We asked a server, not our own, about refills and our chips and she informed us that she would ask our server.  We had to ask a total of three times before chips or refills came.  Our chips ended up coming out with our food forty minutes after we ordered.  Most of us noticed our food was cold, or not cooked to their desired doneness.  The avocados on my Sedona Black Bean Burger were the size of match sticks and looked bruised and some of the onions were papery.  We never saw a manager to comment on the food, nor did our server ask how we liked our food.    When it came time to pay the bill, he had charged one of my coworkers twice for her drink, which was supposed to be free refills.  I would understand this kind of service if it was busy at the restaurant, but there was barely anyone there and we saw him go to all the surrounding tables but avoided ours, especially after he saw we were becoming agitated.  No apology was offered for the late chips, nor was their an explanation as to why he walked away from us.  I'm sorry to say I do not plan on going back to T.G.I. Friday's.""",,status,,2013-01-15 22:58:43,0,2,0

Both times we had the same waitress \xe2\x80\x93 Cynthia. The first trip (mid-November) she was very rude and VERY slow.  It took us 45 min to get our meals (we all ordered soup and salad). When the food finally came, someone said that we have to pack up b/c we only get an hour for lunch, to which she said, ""Well, I guess you better eat fast"".  RUDE!  I can understand delays if you\xe2\x80\x99re new or it is really busy (which it wasn\xe2\x80\x99t) But there is no reason to be rude and abrasive like that.  Today, we went and it took her 15 min to come take our orders, she did not bring us drinks until after our appetizers came. She also did not bring out enough straws and coasters, ever. Our food was very good.  We gave her our payments and when she brought back the folders, she had charged my card for the person next to me and that person the person next to her.  The man next to me got charged for both mine and his meal.  Then, when we pointed it out SHE BLAMED US! Saying we handed it to her together and wrong.  REALLY?!? We each handed her a slip and a card, how did we mess it up?  She ended up charging my bank account twice before the manager helped her void the entire order.  We still do not know who paid for whose lunch or even if we paid at all.  We did not leave a tip and do not plan on going to that Friday\xe2\x80\x99s EVER again!'",,status,,2013-01-15 15:27:26,0,3,0

Friday's but today was the second time at the one at Consol Energy Center in downtown Pittsburgh 15219 that the entire lunch trip was a complete disaster from the service to the mis-payment of all the checks.  \n\nDrink orders were never taken until 25 min once seated (was not busy - 11:30am) and taken with our meal orders.  The food was fine at least.  The waitress (which was the second time we had her for our group of 9) took an extended amount of time coming back to the table and never brought out enough coasters or straws for everyone seated - and never did.  \n\nOnce it was time to pay (separate checks), everyone was charged the wrong check at our table.  Then, it was a hassle to rectify the problem on behalf of the waitress AND the Manager who was less than willing to help.  He was very stand-offish.  We still do not know if our credit accounts were credited properly - will know in a couple days once updated by the banking system.  We asked to have our purchases voided and credited and then re-charged - which they did not give us evidence of this.  So no one knows what they paid for their lunch or how much.\n\nUnfortunately, we will not be going back to this T.G.I. Friday's and have shared our experiences with our co-workers.  This was the second time in less than 6 months that we had horrible service at this one.  We won't try a third.\n\nI know not all of your restaurants have this horrible service but something definitely needs changed at this one - especially when it is a larger party involved.

It was very rude and thoughtless to fire everyone on New Year's Eve without any warning/notice/severance pay.  Many of the employees at this store have worked at this location for 10 years+.  I am deeply saddened that this is the way that your corporation handles its business practices.  The right thing to do would have been to give everyone ample notice to start looking for a job, or at least offered some sort of severance package.  This was a really disgusting way of handling this store closing, especially right after Christmas.  Many people would of liked the option to know they were losing their jobs and maybe would have tightened their belt a little around Christmas, have knowing their position would be terminated.

We were seated by a booth near the bar. We understand that it was a later dinner and people at the bar are drinking and having a good time. However, that\'s no reason to disturb others around them. There were a few (2-3) men at the bar who seemed to know the bartender as well as the waitresses/waiters. They were obviously inebriated and out of control and none of the staff seemed to have a problem with it...instead they were talking and dancing with them right next to our table while we were trying to eat! Another group that was sitting behind us got up to leave and made a comment to the men and a verbal altercation took place...lewd and vulgar language was used which is ABSOLUTELY unecessary in a ""family friendly"" restaurant. What bothered me the most was that the restaurant staff took no responsibility for the obnoxious behavior for these people...instead they egged them on telling them that the customer was out of line for saying something!!! Our waitress included did not apologize to us for such a terrible dinner. I\'m still appalled that the staff or manager did not step in to rectify the situation. Please train your staff...there are people that would love to have a job and would do it right. There are MANY other good and respectable places to eat...next time I will be listening to my friend and going with his choice. VERY DISAPPOINTED. '",,status,,2012-12-08 09:04:19,2,2,0

Unfortunately today I had a horrible dining experience @ the Fowler Ave location in Tampa FL. First we were rushed by the waitress to place our order. Then when we made a small change to our order before the appetizers came out, the waitress got an attitude & rushed off. She only came back with 1 menu. It took forever to bring out the appetizers, & then our entrees came a couple minutes later. When the Parmesan Crusted Chicken came out it was dry, & when my Skillet Garlic Shrimp came out it was ok but the shrimp still had the tails on them. That was odd to me because most dishes have the tails removed. When asking for the take out containers & the check, the waitress sent out someone else with the containers & no check. Then when we asked again she acted like she didn't hear us & kept walking. I wouldn't recommend that location to ANYONE!  I'm VERY disappointed. """,,status,,2012-12-02 01:10:36,0,17,0

On September 4, I wrote an email to TGI Fridays customer service about my recent visit - in short, poor service, poor food (not to mention the wrong food was brought out and our waitress didn't come to our table for over 15 minutes). I was promised that management would contact me to resolve the situation - over a month later, I still had not heard anything, so I wrote another letter - the manager left me a message while I was at work, said he'd call me again the next day since he didn't get ahold of me, and said he'd be sending out compensation for the visit that afternoon. He never called again, didn't send anything, and haven't heard back since. It has now been over two months and I am still left wondering what happened. I'm incredibly disappointed with the lack of response this has generated, let alone the false promises made to me by the manager. I truly wish your CEO could read this and see the damage that you're doing - perhaps you need better training with your guest relations, but so far, I have encountered nothing but disappointment.

I've had better chicken fingers at a local diner for less money.  The chicken fingers tasted like frozen tyson chicken nuggets and she refused to eat it.  My husband ordered a burger with fries and it was overall sloppy and the lettuce was brown and wilted.  My husband waited another 10 minutes for ketchup and the waitress brought out ketchup packets.  If I wanted McDonald's quality food and service that is where we would've gone but I was trying to treat my family to something nicer, which I regret.

Fridays,\nI was dining in your restaurant tonight for my friends 24th birthday, it all started off with the hostess whos name was Constance she was rude had nothing nice at all to say and was very stand offish and acted as if she was better then my friends and I. We had gone in with the mindset of having a great birthday dinner. They were not able to accommodate  us with a table to fit our party. We had friends leave because the staff was so rude, the manager did not help the situation at all. I work at a restaurant and I get the business but the motto we work by is "" we work while others play"". It\'s an obvious that this is not the motto your employees work by. I suggest you speak with your manager Steve Hearing about this problem, or how to resolve a situation like this. I\'m sorry to say that I will not be coming to dine here again. All in all this night ended with my friends and i feeling like we were walking around on egg shells all night.'",,status,,2012-10-07 20:35:06,17,3,0

An hour later we asked our server where our food was, he said he'd check only to gobandbget the other parties food! Meanwhile my nephew is fast asleep without even getting his dinner!

It\'s not fair that if I want to use my reward, then no one else at my table can use any coupons or pick-2/pick-3 deals. I did the math last time and our meal ended up costing MORE money using the ""reward"" than it would have without it (and that\'s just for two people eating, usually I go to Fridays in a group). What is the incentive to earn stripes and earn rewards if you end up WASTING MONEY to use them? Most people do not go to Fridays to eat alone, so it\'s really unfair to not allow the other customers at the table to take part in the value deals just because one person has a reward. I have a ton of stripes racked up but I may never get to use them. Doesn\'t really make me want to go to Fridays anymore. :('",,status,,2012-09-12 08:14:49,3,5,0

My husband is active duty Air Force and while traveling this summer (8-2-12) we stopped off in Omaha, NE to visit the Zoo. While there we decided to grab some take out and called TGIF. There are five people in my family so the order was quite large. They advised us the order would be ready in about 15 minutes. So my husband and my oldest son went to pick up order When my husband arrived he was given the bill. He politley asked them if they gave a military discount. The young lady at the counter said they did and said she needed to get athorization from her manager. After a couple of minutes she returned and said our bill was taken care of. Now this was $61.00 in food. My husband asked several times if they were sure. She said yes, his service to our country was payment enough so they generously gave him the food for free. Imagine the surprise on his face!!! He thanked them for their generousity and handed the hostess a nice tip. I have been meaning to thank them for what they did. Never have we been given so much from a restaraunt. This was the coolest thing and it will never be forgetton. I cannot rememeber the names of the individuals, but the restraunt was by Regency Street, in the mall area. So THANK YOU for your kindness and hsopitality!!!!

I don\'t see how that justifies it, maybe they are used to having dead flies in their food, I\'m not sure.. This is not my first bad experience there, however this will be my last I will not return there no matter what, I\'m tempted to dispute the amount on my credit card, however majority of it was paid on a gift card given to us as a gift.  I\'ve gotten horrible service, under cooked food, and other times the food and service is great, I\'ve complained online, and had their general manager call me back before, I\'m not looking for free food, I\'d take a refund.  But i will not return to that location again, I have over 200 stripe points on my account we eat there whenever we are in the area for local shows at the arena next door, so unless Iowa City gets a TGIFridays I guess those will also go to waste.

My wife's Wedge Salad was not brought to her until her meal came out while everyone elses appetizers were brought out before their meal. Our drinks were all empty as we ate and we had to ask a kitchen employee who was by our area watching T.V. to please contact our waitress so that she may get us more drinks since she was not checking in with us to see if we needed anything else and NEVER brought out glasses of water that a few of us ordered as well as one of our sides of corn that came with one of our meals. We complained to a manager that we did not feel that the 18% Gratuity should be added to our bill since there was MINIMAL effort on our waitresses part to make sure our visit and meal was enjoyable. He stated that it was policy to add this to parties of 8 or more and forced us to pay it and didn't even offer us a solution or compensation to our unsatisfactory visit! This is by far the worst experience at a Restaurant and in no way is an acceptable way to treat a customer who had a legitimate complaint about the service. I, as well as our group of friends, plan on never returning to any TGI Fridays restaurants any time soon since we have been shown that not all of your customers are as valued as your nationally televised commercials lead people to believe!\n\nTGI Fridays #1116 at: 7221 East Carson Blvd. Long Beach, CA 90808 \xe2\x80\x94 """,,status,,2012-08-22 13:23:07,21,4,0

I am a teacher and my colleagues and I like doing some of our planning at TGIF because of the lay back atmosphere. However, last night  at the TGIF in North Miami Beach, my girl friends and I received despicable customer service.  The waiter (Irvence) was rude,  and sarcastic and unapologetic for his lackluster service. He got our orders wrong, and blamed us for not getting it right. Moreover, when we tried to complain to the  manager (kevin) and dispute the gratuity charges that we felt he didn\'t deserve,  he too didn\'t apologize for the  poor service we  received but bolstered the poor actions of the waiter by making a racial comment in a condescending tone: ""okay what do you want? Do guys want something for free"". Assuming  that because we were black we wanting something for free. Then, he calls an off duty police officer to ""monitor"" us. At that moment, I changed from a loyal  patron of your establishment  to  feeling criminalized because I was unsatisfied with horrible service. It  was thus far, the  most deprecating and humiliating experience of my life. No human being should feel that way when trying to enjoy their hard earned money.

I thought managers were supposed to be neutral parties who listen to the customers.  That never happened! Kevin came to our table and told us that they could not help us and insinuated that we were trying to get out of our Happy Hour bill. I asked to speak to another manager and Kevin go talks to an officer.  The officer then stands over our shoulder and told me that he was going to arrest me because I was talking about the poor customer service.  I will never go to TGIFridays again!

We waited there for about 10 minutes before being seated in the empty restaurant.  We wanted a table, but we were seated in a cramped booth in a corner.  \n\nThere was a spray bottle of cleaning solution on one of the seats.  The was completely confused.  Then, we noticed drink spills on our table.  The host was still dumbfounded.  The waiter brought napkins for US to clean up the spills from the previous guests.  We handed him the bottle of cleaning solution that was in our way.  We then noticed food residue all over the table.  The server took one of our napkins to wipe up the food, that spray bottle was never used.  \n\nThe server (Alan) wanted to take our order right away.  We told him we needed a couple minutes to look over the menus.   He came back 20 minutes later.  We even had to wave down another server that we were more than ready to order.\n\nWe were supposed to have complimentary chips.  We asked for them 3 different times before we got them.   When the chips eventually came, we had seven (7) chips on a large plate with a big bowl of salsa.  The chips were very hard and very greasy.   \n\nMy husband and I eventually received our first course.  Our kids still had nothing but the hard chips that they wanted nothing to do with. My daughter was given water, instead of Sprite.  My other daughter never got a lemonade refill after multiple requests.\n\nWe saw people around us seated AFTER us, eat and leave before we even got our food.  I brought this all to the manager\'s attention.  Unbelievably, the bartender was even yelling to the manager that he couldn\'t believe we haven\'t been served yet, because he saw us sitting there so long with no food.  \n\nThe manager asked me, ""What do you want me to do to fix this?""  I asked him what he THINKS he should do to fix this.  At this time, we saw the server bringing our food.  The manager told me and my husband that he would come visit us later to see how things are.\n\nHE NEVER VISITED US!  If he did, I would have pointed out to him that my husband NEVER received his meal.  Eventually, the server shows up to ask how our food is.  My husband told him, ""How would I know?  I haven\'t received my food yet?""  The server\'s response was, ""Sorry boss... I\'ll go get your food.""  \n\nThis was the final straw!  It was now 7:30, and we had had enough.  I went looking for the manager again, but he was nowhere to be found.  We explained to the host, who was at the door, that we were leaving and not paying.  \n\nThat was THE MOST horrible restaurant visit I have ever experienced!'",,status,,2012-04-29 20:00:17,1,12,0

Much to my surprise when the food came out my food was not sizzling and on top of that the waitress had my son's order wrong. Me, being the particular person that I am, I sent the food back and requested it be brought back out to my satisfaction. Upon the waitresses return not only did I have Sizzling Chicken and Shrimp I also had a waitress with a bad attitude. The waitress slammed the plate on the table and then turned and stormed off. I am unsure as to what her deal was but I am someone who works daily in customer service. If I have a problem I am sure not to bring my problems to work. I then spoke with a manager, Frank Bisulca, who was of no assistance at all. Needless to say Friday's has always been one of my favorite restaurants but after tonight I will definitely be re-evaluating this choice. I would never recommend anyone go to this Fridays because of the service, or lack there of that I received on tonight!!""",,status,,2012-03-14 20:53:41,0,8,0

So I figured pick it up, set up the candles, you get the point. Took a coupon (buy one get one) and was told dine on only. I could afford it, but based of pure principle and the fact that you guys should have been more flexible when saying there is a TWO hour wait, I left and got take out from BJ's .. I think when you know it's a day of long waits , like valentines day, mothers day, etc...u should CONSIDER exceptions...some of use love private home celebrations, but also love your food.

The waiter was incredibly rude, and to top it all off, the General Manager, Lauren, was even worse (which, at first, I did not think was possible).  She was unprofessional, and for lack of a better term, completely white trash.  She insisted that we were wrong, while it was the waiter who made the mistake.  Instead of quietly resolving the matter, which would have been the right thing to do in my opinion, she made my family upset. She spoke down to my family, my father in particular, because of the broken English he speaks.  Not only was it upsetting to my family, it was embarrassing to be the center of a situation that could have been resolved so easily. I will NEVER go back to that TGI Friday's, and I am considering never going back to any other location.  Please, save yourself a horrible experience and choose somewhere else where you can actually have a NICE dining experience with your family.

After looking at the menu yet again (after being told there would be vegetarian options), what a surprise that there are none.  So, yet again, 3 out of the 5 people going to have nothing to eat but mozzarella sticks (and, mind you, one of those people is lactose intolerant, so the cheese doesn't really go well).  If you aren't going to offer vegetarian options, you should at least reduce the price if we take the meat out of the pasta or salad dishes (the meat makes up most of the price anyway, so why should I pay for something I'm taking out).  We used to go to TGI Friday's all the time, but now only go for NYE only because it's a tradition.  We've debated going other places, but it's too painful to break tradition.  At least offer veggie burgers!  Almost every other restaurant does, so I'm not sure why you don't.  I'm not sure how much longer we'll keep up the tradition, though, if you don't offer vegetarian options because it's not something we look forward to anymore.  Applebee's is right around the corner for us and they have more options, so we may be there next year if options aren't available.

But, guess if they did that than there would realy be no reason to go to the restaurant.. I know that is the only reason I go. I used to love the food at TGIF's until a few of my past visits, every time I would get my food, it would be cold or some other kind of mishap.. Ome time I ordered that garlic chicken which is one of the best things they ever had on the menu and when the food came to the table, it was barely warm and I imediately noticed that the mashed potatoes were actually microwaved instead of being served fresh and hot. Now I know they have to cut some corners to be able to serve big crowds of people but, you don't cut corners on the spuds! I will never understand why businesses always remove an item that sells and that people love from their menu. That question always haunted me and I am sure allot of other people. I'm lucky!

I was expecting more from TGI Fridays as they are the originators of the art of 'Flair'. 5 countries does 'not' constitute a World Championship, nor for that matter a European one. The fact that you didn't inform anyone that most of the participating countries had in fact dropped out of this competition is disgraceful.

She went to the back for a few minutes and came back with the $14 they overcharged us. Again the only thing this one offered was another ""sorry"". It was only when I said that Sorry wasn\'t good enough.  First I didn\'t get what I wanted becasue the waiter said it wasn;t on sale, then the manager give a lousy offer, then I get overcharged and a sinmple appology.  I asked for the general manager.  She said he wasn in and gave me his telephone #.  It was then that she wrote on the back of the general manager\'s busines card. ""$20.00 of your next visit.""
