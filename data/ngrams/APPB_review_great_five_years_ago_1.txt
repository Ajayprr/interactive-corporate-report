Great pay, great managers, fun way to meet new people were nice, training was always offered and it was a fun atmosphere Great co-workers. I've learned a lot from the restaurant industry and I had the opportunity to work in the kitchen, as a server and even hosting. Hosts move up to the next step typically in 4-6 months, to server in under a year and if you're interested in management this is well within the realm of possibility as well. . The house were pretty flexible Tips, Constant changes to bring people in, good group of people to work with Wonderful place to work at The job itself didn't require much skill and got to work with some great friends. Good money serving, flexible hours, time off easy to get as a host it's a pretty chill job as long as u do the basic requirements, the people i work with make the job worth going to Apple bee's International was a very different place to work when Abe Austin was at the helm. Decent hours, works with school times and after school activities, great people to work with we work 50 hours a week and are encouraged to make time for family. Great Area Directors that treat you like a person, not a number. We make our budgets and are held accountable, but are allowed to move money from one account to another. You do a self evaluation and the managers get together and agree to a specific pay raise, 0-5% with hardly anyone ever gets the 5%. I do enjoy my general manager and our district gm and regional gm are terrific to work with as long as you remember they are not your friends.
