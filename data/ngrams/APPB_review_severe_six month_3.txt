Kitchen crew has a couple of good people who try their best to get it done, but they are dragged down by the chaos of those who they are forced to work with whom have no clue. No team work, favoritism, no neatness with plate representation, high food waste corporate does not care about employees Poor management and communication between management and employees Management was not fair to everyone. Most of the time if some things were not your fault, management will still blame you for it and I thought that was not fair. The cut hours then deny FMLA Host pay is horrible only $5/hr and then you make horrible tip share- you only get 1% of all sales they made while you were hosting!!!. -Applied for server because I have 2 kids and really need the money since I don't have experience they said I could host for a while (which I was OK with) until they hired more hosts than move me up. But then they hired like 3 more servers and one was a college girl that lives with her parents with no experience but he let her be a server because “she needs the money” The people you work with are all fake. Horrible management at my location Management, customers are rude, always on your feet Don't care about the customer service and employees clientele was awful, management was OK GM constantly yelling. A lot of inappropriate behavior and harassment Terrible place of work, the staff treats you like crap, the costumers treat you like crap. Poor management and lack of skill growth Crap training crap hours people disordering when rushes hit during prep it sucks dislike doing dishes all the time and computer training is completely irrelevant managers don't care like they should. Forced to waive breaks, but when you need it they have the right to deny it, not okay.
