Corporation is not good Managers don't really care about employees, schedule is inconsistent Pay wasn't very good and little advancement to become a server Overwhelming, Rude guests, Management, Hours, No room for advancement with in company Everywhere you go you'll find some sort of issues with management, and BJ's is no different. I will say that in my time here, the cons are minimal and the biggest con for me is a personal problem, which is the commute to work. The only other thing that I can think of is the high-turnover rate of employees, meaning you may work with some people who aren't good at what they do, slowing you down or messing up your orders, and people who are shady, rude, or unprofessional. Lastly, shifts can be short if that's what you're looking for, but unless you're able to fill your section and stay busy for the entirety of that time, the real money is made staying on longer which isn't always an option. -management is often in and out. -angry customers late hours, they close at 1 am three days out of the week which can be very exhausting and the kitchen can be a little sometimes slow and cause you to lose tip. Customers can be rude, but remember we are in the business of hospitality. Staff can sometimes have harsh attitudes Hard position to work at in general Really annoying specialty cocktails that take time to make in a very high volume restaurant. The company doesn't really care about its team members either, and the tip out percentage guidelines for servers is only .05%!. The hourly rate for some jobs is too low.
