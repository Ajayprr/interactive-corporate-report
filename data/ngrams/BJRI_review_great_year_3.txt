Employee meals every shift, good food opportunity to grow, flexible with scheduling They have excellent training resources available, the staff is mostly friendly and helpful Not every restaurant is the same, so I am personally speaking from the Katy, Texas location, yet I'm sure this is common to many of the BJ's locations. The management is communicative and willing to work with your schedule. The amount of money that you make depends on your people skills, your ability to act under stress, and any other characteristics typical of a good server, which is my current position. When hurricane Harvey hit, I was pleasantly surprised to find a nice compensation check in the mail from BJ's that was calculated by looking at how much I had worked the previous two weeks, and finding out roughly how much money I lost out on due to the days that our establishment was closed. They use the hot schedules app which is great for students who need shifts covered great work environment, the people you work with become like family. The management is top of the line and always in sync with each other - which reflects on the atmosphere of the store and the amazing team work among st the staff. Good tips Great work environment, management, and food Great training, lots of help provided by management. Consistently busy, strong sense of teamwork fun, fast paced, a good place to make friends Great company with good people and great management in the restaurant!. Excellent training, good support, and flexible management is great and the schedules are pretty consistent. Great job for a college student Loved the people I worked with as well as the managers.
