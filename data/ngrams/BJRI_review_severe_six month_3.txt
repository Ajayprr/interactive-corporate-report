No Communication. Food is always run to wrong tables. No report filed for injuries. No support from management after injuries even with doctors notes. They do not promote the right people Definitely the worst company I've ever worked for ... half the crew is sleeping together or with managers. Only way to work up the ladder.... Very dysfunctional ... never have supplies we need and always under staffed. The appreciate employees who suck and don't acknowledge the top crew . Its sad have to pay out 6% of total sales Worst and most unorganized management ever
