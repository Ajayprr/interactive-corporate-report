No support from management after injuries even with doctors notes. They do not promote the right people Definitely the worst company I've ever worked for ... half the crew is sleeping together or with managers. Only way to work up the ladder.... The appreciate employees who suck and don't acknowledge the top crew . Its sad have to pay out 6% of total sales Worst and most unorganized management ever Abuse workers with time frames regarding breaks/lunches. Unprofessional coworkers(food not prepared correctly/food runners don't read tickets and don't run the whole ticket/buskers only halfway buss tables), circular break rotation, hosts lack knowledge (full section or no tables), relatively no training, hands-off management, and general lac of cooperation between employees. Poor upper management, talk about culture but being nothing to the table. Bad management that makes it difficult to give customers the best experience -Highly unprofessional. -Lack of discipline for employees who come to work late, no call-no show, call out all the time, don't do their work properly, etc. -Lazy Managers. -The unqualified and lazy get promoted faster if they kiss up to management. And even worse management Poor tips.
