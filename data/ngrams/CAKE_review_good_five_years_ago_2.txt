Good food variety the work environment is beautiful and the energy is positive I occasionally got free food when working a double. Usually if you start off that shift in the morning you will end up leaving at around 3 o'clock rush hour or til 5, if you come in around afternoon you get to leave around 7 or even up to midnight. There are some people who understand the stress and can cooperate by being a part of the solution, then there are those who become a part of the problem. -cool to say you worked at the headquarters and not the restaurant. If you needed a day off for whatever reason, it was easy to find a coworker willing to take the shift for you. Decent starting pay and pretty nice co-workers Flexible schedule, they are great about requests and hot schedules makes it easy to pick up shifts, and there are always people that don't want to work. Also, there are food runners and, in some locations, people who take care of the cleaning and marrying of ketchup, for example--all of which reduce your responsibilities as a server, diminishing your side work etc. Great food, lots of employees, free soup/bread on shifts; easy shift trades Working in the restaurant business is always a good way to gain working experience. Kitchen as well as front of house have many rules and regulations, processes and systems in place, which will out you a cut above the rest when it comes to most aspects of the restaurant industry. The people employed by the company are friendly and all work as a team Lot of room for growth, and the company is continuing to grow. Once you become a trainer you have the opportunity to do new restaurant openings.
