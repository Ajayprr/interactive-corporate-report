The pay is good for the amount of work that is expected and you don't have to bus tables which is always a plus. All the employees are so kind and helpful, they'll give new people tips on how to do well and get a rhythm of how the restaurant works. I really like the fact that they give you a week long in-class training course, because it sure helps you out when you actually get on the floor and start working!. The managers saw the potential in me and became great mentors and invested their time in my development. People care about the guest, the staff, the food and the beautiful restaurant. Co-workers are AMAZING, the food is really good, sampling the new food before it hits the menu is always a plus, they work around your schedule. Great ambiance, great boss, and great co-workers Strong training program that really spends the time to help new servers learn the menu and the standards of service. You can maintain a flexible schedule and work far less than 40 hours and still make great money. - Good opportunities to cross-train and grow within the company. - Company is very open to feedback from employees. - Allows for flexible schedules. The place is huge so you can usually get in our out of shifts if you need to, and it stays busy enough that you can make good consistent money (for serving tables).
