I had to quit because I felt like I was I wasn't appreciate with A FREAKING BREAK . So busy daily which makes the time go by but you're going to be an in bad mood every day with your employees attitudes and customers...THE PAY IS NOT WORTH THE PAIN AND STRESS!. Various employees were getting into it on the floor right in front of customers yet all the managers would do was talk to them and maybe give them a “slap of the wrist” type of punishment. Teammates for the most part are good but one of the bartenders lied on me and got me in trouble for no other reason that I rushed her at making my drink The management team was awful in Palm Beach Gardens and was basically a revolving door. While they couldn't do anything to help, the idea of hiring two people to pizza instead of an extra to salad/sandwiches was an incompetent thing to do, and it only added to the stress of working inside a hot, nasty kitchen. . Stress and anxiety levels will go up, Some employees don't even acknowledge you or your food gets bumped but one of the four expediters haven't a clue on how that happened and blame the server for not checking, no problem but if I have to run the food than maybe the hostess should not seat 4 tables at once?. Disorganized, poor management, high school like atmosphere, rude customers, long hours, holidays, bad sections - only favored their favorites Very stressful due to huge sections, disparate treatment from managers, the guests are rude and finicky more often than not, no breaks (the managers went around last year with the legal form that was an option for employees to waive their breaks and instead they said, “Have you signed this yet?”. I served there for over four years and in that time, the job did not get easier because management tends to focus on things that are unimportant instead of the things that would make the restaurant run more efficiently. Way too many egos, abundance of office politics, audio and video not matching(saying one thing doing another), integrity issues, lots of passing the buck from those who are accountable, most superiors do not truly care, growth does exist but you will need to “practically” beg for it, management pay is 10-20% below what it should be, and again, you will need to beg for any increase because they do not really want to give it to you, your ideas are useless because they already know it all, far too many extra meetings, employee events, etc, extreme hours, lots of working from home, overly structured, too many hoops, takes an act of congress to get things done, operating systems in place are overwhelming and much too complex for a restaurant, need to scale down and simplify, sanitation camp; operational failures are a daily battle, huge disconnect between corporate and operations, ivory tower syndrome, pressure is extreme at times feeling of life camp; death instead of food camp; people business, too much change to manage, unethical terminations very low pay, not enough hours Unfair division of table sections I had been told the clientele had gone downhill. (I had been dealing with hard financial problems, and this server had the audacity to step in my way and disrespect me horribly, telling me how to give out more money to my coworkers, (on the night I nearly did everything on my own, all while I was fighting from becoming homeless, which I in turn did.). It is NOT our responsibility to make sure we give you a certain percentage a night, especially when at times we are the ones still busing our tables (Happens so much), run all our food (very rare) or waiting on drinks while you flirt or do whatever with guests (rare but does happen) To demand I give MORE of MY guests tipped money because you chose a less common tipped position, is NOT the servers' responsibility.
