Rarely able to take scheduled break, managers do not help to schedule especially with commuting workers, a lot of favoritism most of the customers that dine there are beyond cheap. They want fine dining 5 star service and want to tip on a Denny's bill. I have worked in restaurants for over 15 years and have never disliked a job so much. Customers would be completely rude and out of line and the management doesn't care, well not about their employees. The managers never back up their employees at all. - Customers who get attracted by Cheesecake Brand don't tip well and you have to pay off a lot of your tips to runners/buskers, when your sales volume is high and tip % low it really feels you spent your time sweating for nothing. - Most customers are rude and overly fussy, loads of drama queens who only want to get an item off their check. - Managers do not care about doing even simple tasks that can lead to more customer satisfaction, they only care to look good in front of someone who is making a mistake by correcting it inappropriately. Forget ever getting a weekend off again. Long Hours. The turnover rate is extremely high so you are constantly working with new people so it's hard for the team to form. There is usually a lot of inconsistencies between middle management. One manager may tell you one thing while another tells you something completely different. Pay should be better.
