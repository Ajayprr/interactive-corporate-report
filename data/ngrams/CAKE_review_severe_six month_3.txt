They want you to do things a very specific way, and yet constantly sets you up for failure by not allowing you the supplies you need to perform well. Also, because the company's motto is the “utmost guest satisfaction,” even though there are 200 things on the menu we are supposed to still allow the guest to create whatever meal they want. It was the worst job I’ve ever had in my life...but I’m happy I have quite a few horrors/funny stories to tell about my experience there Zero teamwork, Favoritism, disorganized management, . I had to quit because I felt like I was I wasn't appreciate with A FREAKING BREAK . So busy daily which makes the time go by but you're going to be an in bad mood every day with your employees attitudes and customers...THE PAY IS NOT WORTH THE PAIN AND STRESS!. The only way to move up in this place is if you do doubles all the time and kiss up to them. This is a position that is at the bottom of the totem pole to the restaurant. . Rude clients at time, managers don't always listen, can walk out with little money if not busy which really is a waste of time excessive hours, none consistency in scheduling, limited advancement Coworkers were rude and aggressive I reported sexual harassment and inappropriate behavior from my managers to HR and was fired two weeks later. It took me anywhere from 10-60 minutes depending on the size of the order. We would have two cashiers behind the counter and one or two more handling curbside. But the later is the one that has to handle the cakes, prep, stock, and clean. There were no structured breaks and, since the cashiers stood around most of the time, I often went an 8 hour shift without a break. You don't get comped meals.
