They want you to do things a very specific way, and yet constantly sets you up for failure by not allowing you the supplies you need to perform well. Also, because the company's motto is the “utmost guest satisfaction,” even though there are 200 things on the menu we are supposed to still allow the guest to create whatever meal they want. I had to quit because I felt like I was I wasn't appreciate with A FREAKING BREAK . So busy daily which makes the time go by but you're going to be an in bad mood every day with your employees attitudes and customers...THE PAY IS NOT WORTH THE PAIN AND STRESS!. The only way to move up in this place is if you do doubles all the time and kiss up to them. This is a position that is at the bottom of the totem pole to the restaurant. . Rude clients at time, managers don't always listen, can walk out with little money if not busy which really is a waste of time excessive hours, none consistency in scheduling, limited advancement Coworkers were rude and aggressive I reported sexual harassment and inappropriate behavior from my managers to HR and was fired two weeks later. Management, Unless a server its bad pay, estimated wait time, Pay was absolutely not worth the amount of stress and crap that came with the job. Various employees were getting into it on the floor right in front of customers yet all the managers would do was talk to them and maybe give them a “slap of the wrist” type of punishment. Teammates for the most part are good but one of the bartenders lied on me and got me in trouble for no other reason that I rushed her at making my drink The management team was awful in Palm Beach Gardens and was basically a revolving door. Tips from guests usually range about 15% at the location I was at, co-workers and managers were racist/homophobic, so many ridiculous requests and bill splits from guests, unfair distribution of side work, not a fun environment to work in.
