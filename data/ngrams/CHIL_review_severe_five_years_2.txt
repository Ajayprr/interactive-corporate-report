The cooks basically had the run of the kitchen, and if the people who had been there longest didn't like you, then they took it out on you by throwing the food you make in the trash, yelling, shoulder checks, etc. Upper management can often let their tempers get the best of them and the company uses religion to cover up the many character flaws or its people which include blaming those down the management team structure, a lack of knowledge on what it means to run a restaurant leading to ridiculous expectations that are used subjectively at every store depending on how much upper management gets along with that Management Team or how much money they make for those above them. Assistant managers are in and out of the stores almost as much as the hourly employees because the training program is not holding everyone to the same level of accountability causing the stores to be short staffed so much so that everyone is expected to travel to guest manage at stores that are up to 80 miles from their home. Busy closing was kind of hard in long management Poor management, not enough staffing, constant drama with staff Ridiculously long hours, ineffective, incompetent, untrustworthy management, filthy work environment, apathetic, lazy, lowlife employees who are only there to pay child support and keep a bag of weed in their pocket, low pay for the work involved, no paid vacation time, anniversary bonuses ($250 per year for years 1-5, about $150 after taxes) in place of paid vacations are an insult, no incentives for doing a good job and going above and beyond. Horribly disorganized A gm who doesn't care for his job who by default became a gm because another manager got fired. Puts the workload on the other management is seen doing little or no work almost will always disappear into the office at busy times and not answer the door, doesn't care how employees feel violated the personal rights of employees doesn't care about people's needs as workers says they need to work for it even when there's evidence that they have done their job, unfair favoritism Freeze on wages for all hourly employees for over 3 years. Server staff suck at teamwork and are selfish The food quality is horrible, the restaurants are all dirty once you make it to the kitchen, there isn't any cohesion between management (after all I have seen three entire management staffing changes in the 3 years I've been there), and after learning every position in the back of the house I still haven't received the raise I was promised. Yes, it can be convenient if the customer is in a rush and makes the customers feel safe as their card never has to leave the table, however, a lot of people simply want to enjoy their experience out and do not want to cash themselves out. Lack of teamwork in both FOH camp; BOH Zero team work lots of lazy people and constant attitude from server's who are among the laziest and management is so horrible they don't care at all and are super fast to cut out and go home leaving all the unfinished work to someone else I had 4 managers that never seemed to communicate with each other and each wanted different things from us. Two of the managers were having affairs with employees and it even went to corporate and they still stayed there and swept it under the rug leaving the team members to be treated like crap for letting corporate know what was going on in this restaurant. Management was way too relaxed Horrible management terrible pay the restaurant is covered in grease and filth the tables and booths are always covered in food from the table before and they treat the young employees like crap lying to them and giving them the worst shifts and making them do numerous jobs at once (which is always the managers extra work they don't feel like doing) There are no benefits to working here except for tips, which of course the company does not provide.
