Experienced Workplace Violence, brought it to management, they laughed, brought it to upper management, they said tell lower management, Homophobia, Racism and Sexism are rampant in this place. Managers calculate your hours based off of if they like you or not. Managers give you days off based off of if they like you or not. Managers cut (allow you to go home) based off of if they like you or not. . Let's say you have your To Schedule and you know you are due to be cut at 9:00pm and therefore made plans. Let's say a Host who picked up a shift (meaning they took that specific work hours by choice) but decided she wanted to go home at 9. Quick as lightning you're suddenly hosting and stuck until closing (12 midnight) and that Senior worker is going home at 9. Also, had to deal with lazy servers, and I did to go so I ended up tending to a lot of the tables' needs. To go was a very fast paced environment and since you're on your own you REALLY have to know what side items go with what dish, etc. - Have to pay for an Application on the phone that is the way they schedule you, etc. - Food takes over 45 minutes to come out on average, so you deal with a lot a lot of angry guests. Favoritism, terrible managers, low tips the worst area to work, people regularly dip out on the tab, it was a franchise before but then was bought by corporate....we didn't know if we would even have a job for a year since they weren't sure about buying the store The managers where horrible, the store manager is a joke. No one is currently leading the brand, they say that there is a direction, but that direction changes all the time; making it no direction at all. Pursuit of diversity comes at a cost, sometimes you get the worst fit for the job but they like it because diversity goals are made.
