Barely learned anything during the training process besides how to wait on a table. My second day of working on my own, I was given a table of 15 on an already busy day (Veterans Day) the managers were very unhelpful and rude that made me want to walk out and quit that day. I wasn’t making a lot of money on my shifts because I’d always be sent home within the first 2 hours of working with only 3-4 tables each shift. Some days they’d put me back as a trainee to help me with the issues I was having (something that I should’ve learned within the first 5 days but hadn’t) last week when the schedules were being made, I didn’t receive one. Was contacted by the manager saying I was going to be retraining and asked what position I’d like to work in the restaurant. Despite my mistakes from a lack of knowledge, I was better than some who had been there for months so I assume they’re trying to force me to quit Area management and above is horrible, turnover for management in general is extremely high. Quality of life is some worst in the field. The franchise I worked for is constantly hemorrhaging both staff and management. I was sent to a store with a GM who was allowed to run the store into the ground. New leadership is out of touch and Woman clearly knows that which is why he has disappeared leaving Kelly to drive the bus off the cliff with her new under qualified sidekicks cheering her on while stock tanks and culture dies.
