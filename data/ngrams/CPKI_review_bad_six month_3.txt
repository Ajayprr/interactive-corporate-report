No real cons that I can think of. Management is seriously lacking at CPK Don't really have anything bad to say. Management was rude and condescending, zero schedule flexibility Again, depends on location. Managers were not as good in one location I worked and not as helpful. At one point, GM was trying to make it so the employees felt like they could let more of their personality show with uniform changes, no scripts, etc. However, they just went back to a lot of the same rules less than a year later, which means I had to buy all new shirts again. Only stayed for so long because of the people I worked with and I knew all the food. Most hourly don't qualify for good benefits. Was promised numerous times I would be considered for higher positions, never even received opportunities to even attempt to gain those positions, nor did any of my other coworkers in the same position. Hosting was extremely monotonous, immediate co-hosts were nice but didn't seem to enjoy talking to me whenever I tried to engage in conversation, was very bored most of the time.
