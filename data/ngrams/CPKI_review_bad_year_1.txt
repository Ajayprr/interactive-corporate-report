At one point, GM was trying to make it so the employees felt like they could let more of their personality show with uniform changes, no scripts, etc. However, they just went back to a lot of the same rules less than a year later, which means I had to buy all new shirts again. Only stayed for so long because of the people I worked with and I knew all the food. Was promised numerous times I would be considered for higher positions, never even received opportunities to even attempt to gain those positions, nor did any of my other coworkers in the same position. Hosting was extremely monotonous, immediate co-hosts were nice but didn't seem to enjoy talking to me whenever I tried to engage in conversation, was very bored most of the time. Hard to get fulltime hours Minimum pay, very little break time They keep raising the menu prices which sometimes makes guests dissatisfied. Managers often just stand around on their phones complaining about the staff which results in very low morale among employees. Hard work frequently goes unnoticed so there is no motivation to try to stand out. Lazy managers - you can tell they only care about numbers so they can make their bonus. Too much miscommunication and disagreement between managers. Kitchen manager makes everybody hate their lives while at work and does nothing to try to improve himself. One of the managers I have will go up to a table and admit to them that you were completely wrong if you made a little mistake and make you look stupid. Sometimes did not get scheduled the way I wanted to.
