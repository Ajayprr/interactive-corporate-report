Amazing company!!. Culture unlike any other, the CEO GJ is very friendly, knows your name and never has his head in the clouds. So many fun events at the RSC and give back opportunities for the community. The People are truly amazing!. Great culture with the company and as a manager you have a great opportunity to hit realistic sales bonus goals. Good starting position to be introduce to the company and restaurant. They will move you up from hostess to server if you want to. Tips are great, co-workers are like family The staff was great and you meet a variety of people. Most of the time the customers tipped fairly, which is 20 percent of the bill. Amazing people, everyone is family and helps coworkers when they really need it.
