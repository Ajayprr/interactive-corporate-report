Staff was dramatic, boss was a rude I had bad experience being a driver than being taking off my job because of a mistake someone made from California kitchen pizza Micromanagement, scheduling issues, for most of the staff it's their first job in the industry so sections are tiny and people freak out, very limited bar almost like a hotel bar. No matter your experience you have to train over a week to even be able to use a jigger. Long hours and rude customers Apathetic management, and overall nastiness in the work place Most coworkers and management were VERY negative. -Little opportunity for vacation time Absolutely horrible top-tier store management, will belittle you for a simple mistake being a new hire. Below minimum wage hourly- they make up for it with tips but its not a lot... Where does one begin... Not only is there a sexist manager, but the general manager does nothing to stop it. When you walk in to start your shift, there is absolutely nothing restocked so you have to spend the first two hours making boxes and filling everything up while taking care of 10 orders at the same time. Then I let the general manager know I no longer wanted to work in those conditions and that I rather work as a server and in return he stopped putting me on the schedule. The GENERAL MANAGER GOES OUT DRINKING WITH THE SERVERS, AND HAS FAVORITES, IF YOU'RE NOT A FAVORITE YOU WILL PROBABLY BE FIRED IN NO TIME. The company had been in trouble for making workers work through lunch without pay and was forced to pay them back, the management was micromanaging much for no reason and was setting quotas for selling their new products. Used to be such an amazing company to work for and the HR departments wants nothing to do with us as employees.
