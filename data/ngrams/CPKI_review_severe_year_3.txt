Staff was dramatic, boss was a rude I had bad experience being a driver than being taking off my job because of a mistake someone made from California kitchen pizza Micromanagement, scheduling issues, for most of the staff it's their first job in the industry so sections are tiny and people freak out, very limited bar almost like a hotel bar. No matter your experience you have to train over a week to even be able to use a jigger. Long hours and rude customers Apathetic management, and overall nastiness in the work place Most coworkers and management were VERY negative.
