When I left they were starting to require their servers to be a little aggressive with sales. Very few opportunities to move up The clientele (bottomless refills are a terrible concept and guests will want to start off with bottomless fries as an appetizer), management can play favorites, and there's a lot of seniority (especially in the bar). None unless you don't like fast paced Schedule based on customer surveys that you sometimes have no control over (under cooked burger, dry bun, wait at the door, etc...) I don't like that sometimes they expect one person to do a 2 man job alone or at least handle the pressure all day long with an upbeat attitude Not a lot of cons. There are going to be days when you don't feel like running around, and speaking with customers. Average pay and long hours Unorganized, Hectic, Management wasn't good at keeping stress level down during peak hours, inconsistent requires tasks that varied by opening/closing manager made it confusing to know what you needed to get done each day or night. The expo position was canceled so on busy nights managers were in the back sorting food when they were needed elsewhere. Not enough hours and negative environment Can get overwhelming and demanding but that's life in the restaurant business. Very bad management team who blame you for things out of your control and do not put an effort into changing their own maladaptive behaviors. All the managers hate their jobs because they get walked all over and lose passion for the food industry. No raises offered (or they will be offered but never implemented) promotion to mid management if you suck up to the higher ups, but you will forever being doing their busy work with no guarantee of ever making salary and no consistency in how you are moved up.
