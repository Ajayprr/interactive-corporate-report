All I ever heard when I raised a valid concern with any level of management was “what do you want me to do” or “my hands are tied” after 16 months of giving it all I had, I had to walk away and find a different job that I felt would care about the well being of their staff. But when they have to chose from putting food on the table and a roof over their head for their kids to doing what is right for the business, the fear of turning in a bad result has superseded the decision to acting with integrity, because having perceived GREEN RESULTS, buys you another day of work and pay. You are graded on a score card every week for your in store sales if you fail to meet the standard you are punished by lack of shifts, if you meet the standard you still get mediocre shifts, if you surpass standards (luck) you will get the shifts worth having. Manager acts childish.got picks.kitchen manager is an idiot.doesn't do much work until manager comes in then he asks like he's been working hard all day.spends most in prep area testing on cell phone.talks to workers nasty.cut hours in a minute.no raises.no benefits, no uniforms.they want you to do 10 jobs for low wage at all times.so many people come and go.too much work, not enough pay.schedules all over the place.you go from 24 hrs.a week to 4 hrs.a week in a minute.don't apply here!. I don't know if there is how they do it everywhere but they don't put you on the schedule until you complete your training so you never know when you are going to work until the end of your shift and then they tell you “you're going to come in on Tuesday from 5-close” or something like that. . My first week of training I worked 4 days in a row, next week I didn't work at all camp; had to wait a whole other week to get paid (that's 3 weeks) they told me I was getting paid 9.25 my first day on the job I was told it was 7.25 while in training camp; they didn't know how long training would be. They made me go into the restaurant almost a week later for what I thought was for me to explain my side of the story, but no it was for me to waste my breath camp; explain myself for them to listen but NOT take into consideration because the GM (who has been 100 miles away in a Connecticut restaurant helping out for the last two months camp; had specifically called me over the phone camp; told me she would leave the decision to the assistant GM) had already made up HER mind camp; decided it was best if I was “ let go “. No team synergy and god forbid the managers schedule enough people for a shift if management is bad you will get crappy schedules (even scheduling you when you said you were going to be out of town and they will still make you find someone to cover your shift), no help in general (other servers will help if they are not too busy), lack of concern if anything goes wrong - it's usually more of a better fix it!. All the money the company pays u goes to tax so your salary is dependent upon your customers (which some nights you will be lucky if you make $20 dollars) Big parties are not required to tip so sometimes you will get screwed and actually lose money (since you have to tip the bar, the busier, and the expo) All of your shifts are going to be based off of your stacked score which is made up of app/dessert sales, loyalty registered to tickets, beverages, and guest service reviews. Before our regional manager was demoted, our general manager was never in the store (especially on holidays and weekends - all the other managers were working 6 days a week, she worked Monday and Tuesday afternoons), it was well-known the GM spent most of her time drinking and getting high at the bar next door, and the kitchen manager had a sexual harassment suit pending forever.
