Not very organized, none of the managers are on the same page so its like working for a different restaurant every shift. Seems impossible to please management, management breaks labor laws frequently (pays you tipped pay for reopening hours in which you do not receive tips), GM frequently made racial seers and insults at kitchen workers, you'll frequently work double shifts consuming the entire day (I mean from 8:30 am to 10 pm) with just a 1-2 hour lunch in the middle (no breaks). Company doesn't follow their own “open-door” policy (management is very intimidating to approach), work is intense and stressful. Either you pay out of pocket or get written up Unprofessional and rude managers, talk down to you, threaten to fire you constantly. *They need to work on getting more money into the pockets of the servers, and put a little less in their own pockets... The management (and most of the FOH staff) is awful. If you're not good friends with the right people, it reflects on everything - especially your schedule, even if the schedule is supposed to be “performance based”. Some managers were some most disgusting people I'd ever met, making lewd comments to and about female servers, and with a pompous do-what-I-say-or-else attitude. Scheduling is also supposed to be flexible, but managers sometimes just ignored requested days off or scheduled employees explicitly when they said they could not work - and then punished employees for not finding someone to cover their shift!. They will send a server they simply don't like home after only one hour of work even if they were scheduled to work 5 in order to give someone they like those hours.
