Corporate is trying to put so much to the bottom line in different cost saving schemes it's hurting the guest experience. Red Robin is corporately under-going changes that aren't beneficial to hourly staff, but rather beneficial to stockholders. Management was elusive and unfriendly, I followed the same server around for all of training, long training time but no time to show what you've learned or take criticism and improve. No support from management. They give people free meals every time someone complains, kitchen runs poor/long ticket times. Management doesn't order enough product because they are only concerned about their bonuses. They make you push guest surveys and if you get one bad one you lose shifts. Neutral surveys don't count to help your score. Lack of communication by management, age discrimination of employees, slow ticket time, small sections, short shifts, birthday songs and singers They openly favor people. If one person doesn't like you they will cut all your hours. You are a number, good reviews only count if they are on kiosks. If you can't convince everyone to take your surveys you aren't considered a good server. They will treat you badly if you have a family emergency and are forced to call out.
