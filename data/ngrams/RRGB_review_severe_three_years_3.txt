You are front of the house so you are the first employee they see so they yell at you. - Series of chores and random tasks. - Only position that won't make tips even if you bus, clean the bathroom, take orders and run out food, and host. All I ever heard when I raised a valid concern with any level of management was “what do you want me to do” or “my hands are tied” after 16 months of giving it all I had, I had to walk away and find a different job that I felt would care about the well being of their staff. I'm already a small person but I went from 120lbs to under 109in the past year from starving, working doubles camp; stressing from management threatening to get rid of me if I don't sell a certain amount of royalty memberships, Be's apps camp; desserts, ECT so they can get their bonuses Management was terrible, and treats people like dirt, they gave virtually no training. While they were being quick and doing there job they never did there job right and always had food going back to the kitchen because they had messed it up completely which would waste food and money Don't care about the hard working team members especially the cooks Expect 50-70hr weeks. But when they have to chose from putting food on the table and a roof over their head for their kids to doing what is right for the business, the fear of turning in a bad result has superseded the decision to acting with integrity, because having perceived GREEN RESULTS, buys you another day of work and pay. You are graded on a score card every week for your in store sales if you fail to meet the standard you are punished by lack of shifts, if you meet the standard you still get mediocre shifts, if you surpass standards (luck) you will get the shifts worth having. Manager acts childish.got picks.kitchen manager is an idiot.doesn't do much work until manager comes in then he asks like he's been working hard all day.spends most in prep area testing on cell phone.talks to workers nasty.cut hours in a minute.no raises.no benefits, no uniforms.they want you to do 10 jobs for low wage at all times.so many people come and go.too much work, not enough pay.schedules all over the place.you go from 24 hrs.a week to 4 hrs.a week in a minute.don't apply here!. -Management will disappear in the back during the last hour of the shift... when there is no busier or expo, meaning the remaining two closing servers are stuck doing everything in the restaurant with no back-up or help, which is especially awful if the restaurant suddenly gets busy again. . I don't know if there is how they do it everywhere but they don't put you on the schedule until you complete your training so you never know when you are going to work until the end of your shift and then they tell you “you're going to come in on Tuesday from 5-close” or something like that. . Constant, conflicting corporate initiatives, never ending free product camp; discount programs, management is always working an hourly position to achieve labor metrics make running the stores high stress for the management and hourly teams If you're over 18, the place to work there is too young for you.
