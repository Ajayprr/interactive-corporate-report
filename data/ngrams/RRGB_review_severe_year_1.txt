Management was elusive and unfriendly, I followed the same server around for all of training, long training time but no time to show what you've learned or take criticism and improve. They make you push guest surveys and if you get one bad one you lose shifts. Neutral surveys don't count to help your score. They will treat you badly if you have a family emergency and are forced to call out. - Micromanagement (beverage, appetizer, rewards) writes always chosen. - Even if you work harder than others they don't see it. - Servers always yell at you in front of customers. - Customers yell at you. You are front of the house so you are the first employee they see so they yell at you. - Series of chores and random tasks. - Only position that won't make tips even if you bus, clean the bathroom, take orders and run out food, and host. Granted, this will vary from location to location, but in my experience, there were 3 employees who had been there for 3-5 years and they acted like they owned the place. They do not care about resolving your problems and their answer to ANYTHING that you are unhappy with is “There's the door”. . Constantly being yelled at by management about one thing or another. Free fries are inconveniencing to cooks. Trainers are very mean. Nobody ever wants to work. Have to wait until half the restaurant can be shut-down before “phase” can happen. Bad news if your Gm stinks (mine did) they don't follow these best practices and only care if it's pointed out they also cut labor and give poor service to guests then get guest complaints and blame it on the GMT team, but it's really poor leadership and improper thinking in how to drive sales not reduce costs. Don't expect to actually manage, you'll spend half the time doing your employees jobs as labor is tight within the company.
